Omniknight Tips 

Go for Purifications in lane whenever melee enemies are going in for last hits.

Purification can damage invis enemies. If you pay close attention, you can faintly see some diamond particles traveling to the invis target if you land it.

Use Guardian Angel more like a Mek than Shallow Grave. There's no reason you can't start getting dat Omniscient love with your team once they're all at half HP, rather than in Culling Blade range.

Targets that are banished at the time of Guardian Angel's cast will still receive the buff.

Omniscience is core for fountain diving. Guardian Angel will completely negate any damage from towers since they're physical damage.

Eul's Cyclone, Invoker's Tornado, and Storm Panda's Cyclone (and obviously Dispel Magic) can dispel Guardian Angel. As does Oracle's Fortune's End and Shadow Demon's Demonic Purge.

Nullifier and Necronomicon level 3 can also be used to purge Guardian Angel.

Rubick's wet dream. "Oh I better cast something before Rubick steals Guardian Angel... but I don't want him getting Repel. Wait, I don't want him getting Purification either..."
