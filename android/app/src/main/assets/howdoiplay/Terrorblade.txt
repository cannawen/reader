Terrorblade Tips 

Reflection only catches heroes in vision.

Reflection illusions carry all the auras that normal enemy illusions carry.

Use Conjure Image illusions to stack the jungle, serve as wards, intercept an incoming creep wave, or deny runes in the early game.

Remember that you lose some movespeed when you're in Metamorphosis.

If you're planning on getting aggressive in lane soon, it's in your best interest to pre-cast a Conjure Image and hide it. 16 seconds later, load up another one and then go in.

Manta Style has a longer cooldown and weaker illusions for ranged heroes than melee heroes. Activate Manta before casting Metamorphosis.

Sunder can be cast on allies and illusions (like Conjure Image or Manta illusions).

Sunder has a minimum HP transfer of 25%. So if you and an ally are both under 25% HP, Sunder will heal you both.

Sunder works through spell immunity.

You can Sunder through AA's Ice Blast to gain HP. You can Sunder a Borrowed Time Abaddon to make him lose HP.

Infused Raindrops are amazing on TB. He has tons of armor, but is very susceptible to magic damage nukes. The mana regen from the item is just gravy.

Reflection illusions carry all things that normal illusions carry. This includes item auras, so be wary about building things like Radiance or AC against a TB.

TB has armor out the butt, but very little HP to back it up. Magic damage makes life for TB and his illusions hell. If your team is mostly physical damage, consider building Maelstrom or Shiva's (yeah I know I just told you not to build auras, but Shiva's is usually worth it) to clear his illusions.

Sunder. It's a spell. One that you should be acutely aware of when trying to kill him.

Sunder works through spell immunity.

Any level of Dagon can instakill illusions.
