Dragon Knight Tips 

Breathe Fire's damage reduction component is a big deal in team fights. Don't save it for kill stealing, use it early on in a fight.

Dragon Form's passive attack (Corrosive Breath) works on towers. This is what makes DK such a mean pusher early on.

The transformation into Dragon Form is nearly as useful as the Dragon Form itself during the laning phase. No one ever expects you to suddenly go full Dragon and whip out a ranged stun in the span of no seconds. People know how far to stand away from a DK in Knight form and people know to stand much further back from a DK in Dragon form. Don't give them the chance to adapt.

Silver Edge Breaks DK's Dragon Blood passive. Most DK's skimp on survivability since they can rely on this spell for tankiness, so Silver Edge can go a long way for killing DKs.
