Shadow Fiend Tips 

Cancel your Razes. The cast time is long, so if you know you're going to miss, hit the stop key.

Landing multiple Razes adds stacking amounts of damage on neutral/enemy targets and Roshan. Each stack lasts 8 seconds.

If you're having a hard time in lane, go head to the nearest jungle camp and Raze it down for quick souls.

One of the most useful heroes to learn Tread switching for since he can make use of all three attributes and frequently gets a Bottle.

Clockwerk Cogs have souls for some reason. If you're very tryhard, you can coordinate you, one other hero, and a Clockwerk in the fountain to get some early Necromastery souls before the game starts.

Almost the entire Requiem of Souls cast animation is hidden by Shadow Blade invisibility.

The visual of SF's Agh's Requiem returning to SF's location is inaccurate. Agh's Requiem always starts and returns to the same location on cast. So you can't cast Requiem and then Blink on top of an enemy for massive damage.

Destroying SF's laning phase is the textbook example of "shutting down" a hero. The hero doesn't have any escapes and isn't very tanky. He can recover by stacking and razing down jungle camps so if you really want to make sure he doesn't become a threat, block his jungle camps as well.

Don't forget that he mini-ults when he di--too late, you ate it.

Remember that SF loses half his Necromastery souls on death. So if he just respawned or bought back, he's not going to be at full power.

Infused Raindrop can block the 'landing' damage on Eul's, allowing you to Blink out if SF tries to Cyclone+Ult combo you.
