Venomancer Tips 

Veno is a great hero to practice harassing without drawing creep aggro. Poison Sting isn't an orb, but with good aggro control, you can almost have it behave like one.

Some people don't like skilling Plague Wards early because they claim it pushes the lane. That would be right, if it weren't completely wrong. LET ME BREAK DOWN SOME XxX360NOSTOPWARDCONTROLxXx.

tl;dw - Use the stop key and use unified unit orders. No one is forcing Plague Wards to constantly attack. Stop them if there are no heroes around, sic them all on a creep at the same time to last hit or deny, put them up on cliffs and tell them to shut up so they don't alert an enemy who didn't know you could see them.

This is also useful when chasing enemies down with Plague Wards. When you throw one up ahead, don't waste time selecting it to acquire a target, just issue a unified ctrl+right click on the enemy hero.

Plague Wards have collision and can be used to block narrow paths.

Try to deny your Plague Wards in lane.

Veno is damn good at harassing junglers. Plague Wards block camps, have an awesome cast range, short CD, last forever, and are impossible for enemies to kill quickly enough without blocking a camp themselves. Even beyond that, Poison Sting is really hard to deal with for most junglers.

With one cast of a 4 point Gale and one attack with a 4 point Poison Sting, you do ~850 magical damage over 15 seconds.

In a team fight, your job is to Bell, Biv, and DeVoe every hero in the vicinity. Each of your poisons last for ~15 seconds, so you need either your Poison Sting or Venomous Gale on everyone to give a final tick of lethal damage post-Nova.

Always be on the lookout for opportunities to deny your allies. You can't deny Poison Sting or Nova, but you can deny allies under Venomous Gale.

Poison Sting DoT does not cancel healing. If you're about to die to Poison Sting, use your Salve without fear.
