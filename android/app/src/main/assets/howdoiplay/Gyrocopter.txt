Gyrocopter Tips 

You can use Force Staff on the Homing Missile for some reason.

Flak Cannon hits creeps if you're targeting a tower, but it won't hit the tower if you're attacking creeps.

Taking on Gyrocopter 1v1 in the early or mid game is probably suicidal. Rocket Barrage deals a ton of magic damage to you if you eat all of it. Get a huddle going with your creeps if Gyro is trying to make a move on you.

You can dispel Rocket Barrage.

Creeps can't kill the rocket. While they draw aggro from it, only tower shots or hero attacks can damage it.
