Lich Tips 

Sacrifice is almost always the first thing you level and you should usually eat a ranged creep (more XP given than a melee creep) at 0:00. Ideally, you should eat it from mid lane if you trust your mid.

You can Sacrifice siege creeps.

You can cast Ice Armor on creeps. If you're trying to help out on a push, start slapping Ice Armor on all your frontline creeps to slow the enemy's melee creeps and buff up your own.

You can cast Ice Armor on all towers and buildings.

Don't always let the Chain Frost go as soon as you get into cast range. The projectile is incredibly slow and targets will usually split faster than the ball can travel. The closer you can get to your initial target, the better chances you have of getting successful bounces off.

You're losing out on a lot of experience per wave when laning against Lich because of Sacrifice. The enemies will likely hit 6 significantly before you do, so beware of aggression.

It's very hard to win a lane against Lich for this reason. However, you can turn this power against him by pushing hard and taking his tower early since he'll have a shortage of creeps each wave. Even if you don't have good pushing heroes, try single pulling a wave.

Ice Armor can be purged.
