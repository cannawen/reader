Legion Commander Tips 

Press the Attack is as strong of a dispel as Aphotic Shield. Please cast it on allies to wipe off disables.

You can milk a lot of lifesteal from a single jungle camp by spamming the stop key while right clicking a creep. Your normal right clicks will get canceled and only Moment of Courage procs will go through.

The standard max-greed Duel procedure is using Press the Attack, casting Overwhelming Odds on the target, activating any items (Solar Crest, Armlet, Blade Mail, BKB), then Dueling your target. Like a Nyx Assassin, though, you'll need to trim ingredients in the combo as the game progresses in order to get the Duel off.

If you have a Shadow Blade/Silver Edge, don't Duel straight out of invis. Duel counts as a spell, so you won't get the bonus Backstab damage from these items unless you right click the enemy first.

Tread switching is an important thing to utilize on LC since she is a STR hero with fairly mana intensive spells. Remember to stay off STR treads until the healing from Press the Attack is complete, but also remember to not stay on INT treads for 15 minutes straight until someone pings you after a Duel loss and you sheepishly swap back.

Unlike Berserker's Call and Winter's Curse, Duel applies a silence on the target in addition to the taunt, so Ursa can't Agh's Enrage and Abaddon can't manually cast Borrowed Time while Dueled.

Simple spells to mess with Duel: Dazzle's Shallow Grave, Oracle's False Promise, Wyvern's Cold Embrace, Bane's Nightmare, OD/SD/Tusk banishes.

You can avoid some Duel damage using Disarms (Heaven's Halberd, for example) or Ethereal states (Ghost Scepter).

LC loves going against teams with a bunch of summons thanks to Overwhelming Odds, so draft accordingly.
