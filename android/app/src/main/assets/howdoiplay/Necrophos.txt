Necrophos Tips 

"Nah he's dead, Death Pulse will kill him." HAHAHAHA, no. Death Pulse never gets them. Somehow people will always heal just barely enough HP just in time that the skull won't kill them. Always finish the kill either with Heartstopper, Scythe, or auto attacks.

You get Death Pulse regen stacks off of any unit you kill including buildings, wards, and creep denies. The only exceptions are illusions and Tempest Doubles.

Ghost Shroud boosts HP/mana regen given to you from all sources, including teammates. Shroud yourself before a Chakra Magic or Purification or Mekansm or Arcane Boots. Essence Aura doesn't get boosted, though.

Also, Shroud yourself before using a Magic Wand (which is absolutely core on Necro because of Ghost Shroud).

Ghost Shroud makes you immune to physical damage even from spells, such as Jugg's Omnislash or Tidehunter's Anchor Smash.

Death Pulse can hit invis and fogged units.

The stun on Reaper's Scythe goes through BKB. That's neat.

For heroes with standard magic resistance the magic numbers for getting a kill with Scythe are at ~31%/35%/40% of HP remaining.

You can't disjoint Death Pulse, so don't bother trying.

Glimmer Cape absolutely obliterates Necro. Save it for when he's Scything a target and then be amazed at how little damage the Scythe does.

Dazzle's Shallow Grave, Oracle's Fate's Edict and False Promise, and heroes that can banish a Scythed target like Shadow Demon, Outworld Devourer, and Tusk are also good counters. Also Bane Nightmare.

Ghost Shroud can be purged the same ways as Ghost Scepter (Necrobook 3, Nullifier, Fortune's End, Demonic Purge, etc.)

Necro is taking bonus magic damage whenever he's in Ghost Shroud, so try to bait it out before tossing high magic damage nukes.

Spirit Vessel can prevent him from healing as much.

Necro loves playing against heroes who frequently give Stick charges, especially in lane.
