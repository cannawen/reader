Chen Tips 

Penitence's damage amp works on Roshan.

Don't bring your whole entourage back to base if you need to refill HP and mana. Leave your creeps in the lane and try to pick up last hits, or send them to jungle/ancient camps and start stacking.

The net on the Dark Troll Summoner goes through spell immunity.

The ranged Satyr's purge can target and dispel allies.

The Tornado from the Wildwing Ripper does not draw aggro when used on neutral creeps, allowing you to damage an entire stack or kill ancients without them moving around constantly.

When you lose control of a Mud Golem, it will instantly split, but you will still have control of the Shards. Early game you can use this to stun an enemy with the Mud Golem, Persuade a lane creep to force the split, and then have two more Shard Golem stuns.

Persuaded enemy lane creeps will benefit from the Glyph invulnerability.

Persuading allied lane creeps will send them back to the fountain, allowing you to mess with creep equilibrium in the early game.

Agh's allows you to control 3 Ancients when Hand of God is maxed, but you're still allowed more normal creeps. Don't forget about Alpha Wolves and Kobolds and other useful aura creeps after you amass an ancient army.

Holy Persuasion's Teleport can't be stopped by stuns, silences, or banishes, but you can dispel the buff off an enemy to cancel the TP (Eul's, Nullifier, Necrobook 3, Oracle's Fortune's End, Shadow Demon's Demonic Purge, etc).

Consider getting a Midas or Helm of the Dominator if you're up against a Chen. Watch him fumble through his control groups before he realizes that you turned his Satyr into your Ogre Club.

Heroes with spells that notably affect creeps are big counters against Chen. Crystal Maiden's Frostbite, Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask, Doom's Devour, Lifestealer's Infest, and Clinkz's Death Pact are a few specific examples.

Diffusal Blade can root creeps.
