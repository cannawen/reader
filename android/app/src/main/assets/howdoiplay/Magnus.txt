Magnus Tips 

Ranged allies are still benefiting from the bonus damage from Empower. You can't give Luna cleavage, but I'm sure she won't mind the extra damage.

Empower only amplifies base damage and damage from attribute items, not +damage items.

Skewer only goes as far as you click if you're not maxing out the range. I know you're really excited that you actually landed a 3-man RP, now just pan the camera a bit and you've got it made.

No one is forcing you to use Skewer to drag enemies all willy nilly. You can also use it at close range mid-gank to inject enemies with the movespeed slow from your horn or use it to destroy a treeline to help your team close a gap.

When Skewering to escape, don't freaking carpool with the people who are ganking you. It's smart to go past cliffs with Skewer, but it's dumb if you're bringing the enemy with you. Choose a Skewer destination that is not only far, but also at an angle that won't drag undesirables along for the ride.

By default, your team of random pubs will generally assume that you're not going to Skewer after a good Reverse Polarity. It's worth sacrificing the positional benefit from Skewer just to make sure you're not causing your teammates to whiff their spells on where they thought the enemies would be.

Keep your finger primed on the stop key when you're initiating or ganking. It's pretty easy to tell when you're about to whiff your RP, so be prepared to cancel your cast.

After you Blink into the enemy team, right click behind you as you cast RP. This'll get Magnus to rotate as you're casting RP and all the enemies get stunned at the desired Skewer angle without you having to run around behind them.

Magnus cannot Skewer when rooted.

When you're mid against Mag, it's obvious when he's trying to push the lane so that he can get the rune. He's going to auto attack all the creeps a bit and then he's going to Shockwave at a very predictable angle. There isn't much you can do to stop this (other than harassing him hard), but at least don't get hit by the Shockwave. It wasn't even meant for you.

Reverse Polarity is one of those skills that's worth keeping track of, mainly because it's a stupid powerful ult, but also because it has a pretty easy to remember cooldown of ~2 minutes (120s, 110s, 100s).
