Lina Tips 

While Lina has a terrible auto-attack animation, she also has ludicrous range to compensate. Few heroes can trade hits with you, despite your pizza spinning auto attack.

Dragon Slave can hit units almost 500 units further than the cast range of the spell, so stick to ground targeting if you're trying to damage an enemy that's escaping.

It's okay to blow a few spells to keep Fiery Soul stacks up. Once you have a high enough mana regen, you can keep yourself at Sonic speeds by alternating between Dragon Slave and LSA. Build up stacks in the fountain before a TP or use spells on nothing to speed up an escape.

Laguna Blade has a stupid short cooldown for how effective it is at 6. Abuse it.

An Agh's upgraded Laguna can target and kill couriers.

Laguna Blade will only penetrate BKB once Lina gets an Aghanim's Scepter.

There is an extremely brief (0.25s) moment after Laguna Blade connects before the damage is actually dealt. You can dodge the damage with banishes from spells or from something like Manta Style if your timing is impeccable.
