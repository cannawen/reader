Huskar Tips 

Inner Vitality can be cast on allies and has a fairly low cooldown for the amount that it heals. Cast it on your friendly neighborhood support after a team fight to make their life much easier. Or if you're falling behind in a game and are no longer the primary damage dealer, cast it on your team's carry.

Turn on your Armlet after you Life Break, not before, to lose less HP.

Spell immunity will block the self-damage from Life Break.

Life Break dispels yourself on cast.

You really need some form of pure damage or solid physical damage if you're planning on dealing with Huskar. Berserker's Blood gives him high levels of magic resistance. Timbersaw is probably the ideal counter. Other good heroes would be OD, Silencer, Tinker, or Bane.

Viper is good at dealing with Huskar since Nethertoxin breaks Berserker's Blood and Corrosive Skin loves Burning Spears.

Silver Edge breaks his Berserker's Blood passive.

Life Break is a strong dispel, but even strong dispels can't purge off the disarm from Heaven's Halberd.

Spirit Vessel can mitigate a lot of the regen he gets from Inner Vitality at low HP.

Even though he's mostly magic damage, Ancient Apparition can make life hard for Huskars since Ice Blast prevents Inner Vitality and lifesteal from healing and because Huskar gets very close to Shatter-range when he wants to max out Berserker's Blood.
