Drow Ranger Tips 

Drow not only has stupid long attack range, but she also has an orb effect. Abuse this in lane. If you're not able to get last hits because her animation blows, at least make life annoying for whoever is in your lane.

Remember that Power Treads can be built from a Band of Elvenskin instead of a Belt of Strength (or Robe of the Magi). It's not much, but this can give you some much needed early attack speed to help your last hitting.

The knockback on Gust doesn't break item channels, so don't bother using it to cancel a TP.

However, the knockback does move enemies, making it cancel Templar Assassin's Meld and Shadow Amulet.

You have to activate Precision Aura if you want ranged summons like Visage's Familiars or Enigma's Eidolons to benefit from the Aura.

Post-Agh's, all split arrows will have whatever on-hit effects the main arrow has. All 3 arrows will independently roll for crit/bash/lightning and all 3 arrows will have the Skadi/Deso/lifesteal effect.

You can use Marksmanship's particle effect and agility buff disappearing to detect if invis heroes are hugging you.

Get in her face. There is nothing Drows hate more than someone in melee range of her. If a hero is within 400 range of her, she loses the agility bonus from Marksmanship, so try closing the distance even if you're a ranged hero.

Precision Aura is granted by illusions of Drow. Shadow Demon, Terrorblade, and Dark Seer can take advantage of this.
