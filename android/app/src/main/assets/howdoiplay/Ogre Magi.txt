OgreÂ Magi Tips 

Ogre can trade hits with the best of them in lane. Dude has ridiculous starting armor and a bucket of HP to boot. To give perspective, he has more EHP at spawn than a level 6 Crystal Maiden. Plus, he has higher than average base HP regen JUST 'CAUSE. Love the chuft, fear the chuft.

At max Multicast, the range on Ignite is nearly the same as Blink Dagger range. This can be a really simple way to turn off an initiator's Blink Dagger during the DoT.

An early level in Bloodlust can be a big deal. 10% movement speed can very easily turn around or secure a gank.

You can cast Bloodlust on towers.

Late game, you should be butter churning Bloodlust into every allied unit on the map if you have the mana. Heroes, creeps, Spirit Bear, siege creeps... Beastmaster's Hawk?

The courier can also be given the lust for Blood.

Even though running's not as fun as hitting, Ogre is a chaser extraordinaire. His only downfall is his slow cast times. If Ogre's chasing you down, try running into tree fog often.

Rubick can't Multicast stolen spells, but his stolen spells do benefit from the mana cost/range/AoE/cooldown changes granted by Multicast.
