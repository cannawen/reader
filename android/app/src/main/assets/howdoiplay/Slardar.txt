Slardar Tips 

You can cast Sprint while TPing and it won't break the channel.

Once maxed, Sprinting in the river will give you bonus move speed.

Avoid Sprinting during fights. You usually want to use Sprint either to get to a fight or when you're chasing someone down. The bonus damage you sustain isn't that dramatic, but every little bit counts.

Slithereen Crush and Bash procs deal physical damage, making them work very well with Corrosive Haze's armor reduction.

Cancel Crush's animation. You can usually tell when you're not going to land it.

Corrosive Haze can be cast on siege creeps to help quickly bring them down during a push.

Corrosive Haze lets your team take Rosh extremely early in the game.

Corrosive Haze's true sight isn't some sort of get-out-of-buying-detection-free card. The way to counter invis heroes is to know where they are before they know you know where they are.

Slardar's Sprint can be purged.

Juke left or right if Slardar is chasing you and trying to Crush your Slithereen. The AoE on the stun is tiny and the cast animation is lengthy.

Corrosive Haze allows the enemy team to take Roshan super early. Keep the pit warded up tight.

Like with Dust or Track, Corrosive Haze can be purged off by Lotus Orb, Guardian Greaves, Manta Style, or Slark's Dark Pact.
