Queen of Pain Tips 

There's a cast time on Shadow Strike, so stop-cancel it to bait out defensive spells from enemies.

Only Blink to initiate if you're absolutely positive that the enemies can't take a fight when you show up. If it turns out that Lion had just enough mana for a Hex and now Ursa is TPing in, that Blink cooldown is going to feel like an eternity.

Scream of Pain can hit invis units and units in fog.

Sonic Wave can kill couriers.

Shadow Strike is not a constant DoT. There's an initial nuke damage when the projectile hits and then a tick of damage every 3 seconds (5 ticks, for 15 seconds). Get a quick Bottle sip or Armlet toggle between ticks to stay alive.

Shadow Strike's projectile can be completely disjointed by invisibility and blinks.

Watch her Blink animation to determine the direction that she Blinks in. The particle 'cone' always points in the direction that she traveled.
