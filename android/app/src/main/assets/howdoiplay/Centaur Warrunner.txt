Centaur Warrunner Tips 

You can mask the animation of Hoof Stomp by casting it in the middle of using a Force Staff. Since the cast time takes roughly as long as the Force travel time, you'll arrive at your destination and stomp immediately without showing the Hoof Stomp animation.

Double Edge costs no mana, so use it as your primary pushing spell late game.

If you have a Hood of Defiance, don't forget to use the active Spell Shield liberally to absorb Double Edge self damage.

Return damages towers. Be a man and draw aggro from the tower to speed up the pushing process. If you want to force aggro, right click any enemy hero anywhere on the map while you're in tower range, or just be the closest target attacking the tower.

The "Return Aura" talent scales off of Centaur's strength, not the hero being attacked.

Pay attention to when you can use Stampede from across the map. If your boy Shadow Fiend is getting ganked, don't be shy about turning on your lawnmower with R. Similarly, if SF is ganking Luna, but just can't keep up, use your ultimate.

Leave Tranquil Boots on the ground or in your backpack when farming so you can pick them up after getting some last hits and not have to wait for the damage cooldown to start healing.

After you get Blade Mail, try to find ways to hurt yourself during its duration. KotL about to bust out an Illuminate? Gimme. Chaos Meteor rolling around? I love meatballs. Bloodseeker Rupture you for some reason? Yeeeeehaw.

Hoof Stomp has a pretty small radius. If you see a Centaur is trying to run side by side with you to ensure that he'll land it, don't keep moving straight, juke left or right.
