Kunkka Tips 

Abuse Torrent's huge cast range. The spell has a very obvious cast animation and will likely get juked if the enemy sees you Bellamy salute. Cast it from the fog or high ground or combo it with a ally stun.

Your hero can be facing in any direction when casting Torrent.

If you get trapped in trees, you can Torrent the enemy and walk underneath them.

Torrent has multiple ticks of damage, making it useful for burning off things like Treant's Living Armor or Templar Assassin's Refraction.

If Tidebringer is on autocast, you can deny allied creeps with the bonus damage and not have the spell go on cooldown.

You can cast X on yourself or an ally before getting Teleported somewhere. Use this to quickly go back home, get a few Bottle charges or pick up something from the shop, and then quickly come back on the lane.

If you're playing against enemies with short banishes (SD, Puck, PL, anyone with Eul's) stop-cancel your Torrent animation after X-ing to bait out usage of these banishes. Then just wait for the banish to end and continue the combo.

X Marks the Spot is not dispelled on death, so in theory you can buyback and Return to your X.

If Kunkka's sword is glowing, get ready to receive a face full of Tidebringer.

The splash effect on Tidebringer is visible on invisible units. Don't sneak around in front of a Kunkka if you're invisible because he will likely wonder why there was a poof of water on nothing.

Going spell immune mid-X will prevent you from getting returned. Cycloning yourself with Eul's can also dodge it, but you need to time it.

You can also use the Eul's Cyclone tactic on enemy X's if Kunkka's being coy by X'ing an ally and then putting them massively out of position before returning them.
