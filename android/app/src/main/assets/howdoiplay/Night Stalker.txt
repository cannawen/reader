NightÂ Stalker Tips 

You don't need to pop everything on one target during a gank. Silence one hero, Void another hero, then kill them all.

Avoid taking traditional ganking routes if possible. You're crazy fast at night and you can fly over walls so you can afford to sacrifice some travel time in order to avoid walking into typically warded areas.

Use TPs liberally during night time. Show yourself in one lane, then TP to another once the wave dies. This makes your ganks far more unpredictable.

Buy your own wards if you need to. It takes no time at all for you to run into the enemy jungle to ward it up and you'll make back the gold in just one kill.

Leveling Darkness at 6 is situational. If you would rather make your killing potential higher with another level in Hunter for the first night, skip Darkness until later.

To fully exploit Darkness, you really need to understand how blind enemies are when it's active. Every enemy hero will have vision in only a 675 radius around them when it's Night Stalker O'Clock. That's essentially auto attack range for ranged heroes.

Don't be afraid to use Darkness even at night. If you're not near your team and they're getting in a fight, you can use Darkness to help reduce enemy vision even further.

Night Stalker sees as much at daytime as most heroes see at night. If you see him when the sun's out, remember that he only has 800 day vision and may not even know you're there.

NS is essentially an M1 Abrams with wings. Dude has extremely high armor with no items. This is what makes him such a terrifying tower diver.

Like against Bounty Hunter, if NS blows his stun early, try to TP out.

Lycan can sometimes be a counter to NS since Howl gets a lot of extra bonuses at night time and Lycan has 1800 night vision when in Shapeshift.
