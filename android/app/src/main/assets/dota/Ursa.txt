Ulfsaar, the Ursa Warrior

Agility Hero

Ulfsaar the Warrior is the fiercest member of an ursine tribe, protective of his land and his people. During the long winters, while the mothers sleep and nurse their cubs, the males patrol the lands aboveâ€”as tireless, vigilant defenders of their ancient ways. Hearing dim but growing rumors of a spreading evil, Ulfsaar headed out beyond the boundaries of his wild wooded homeland, intending to track down and destroy the threat at its source, before it could endanger his people. He is a proud creature with a bright strong spirit, utterly trustworthy, a staunch ally and defender.

Earthshock
Ursa slams the earth, causing a powerful shock to damage and slow all enemy units nearby.
Overpower
Using his skill in combat, Ursa gains maximum attack speed for a number of subsequent attacks.
Fury Swipes
Ursa's claws dig deeper wounds in the enemy, causing consecutive attacks to the same enemy to deal more damage. If the same target is not attacked after a few seconds, the bonus damage is lost.
Enrage
Ursa goes into a frenzy, causing him to take less damage from any source and causes his attacks to multiply Fury Swipes damage. Removes any existing debuffs upon cast.

 Upgradeable by Aghanim's Scepter. Allows Enrage to be cast while disabled and decreases the cooldown.
