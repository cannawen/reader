Mirana, the Princess of the Moon

Agility Hero

Born to a royal family, a blood princess next in line for the Solar Throne, Mirana willingly surrendered any claim to mundane land or titles when she dedicated herself completely to the service of Selemene, Goddess of the Moon. Known ever since as Princess of the Moon, Mirana prowls the sacred Nightsilver Woods searching for any who would dare poach the sacred luminous lotus from the silvery pools of the Goddess's preserve. Riding on her enormous feline familiar, she is poised, proud and fearless, attuned to the phases of the moon and the wheeling of the greater constellations. Her bow, tipped with sharp shards of lunar ore, draws on the moon's power to charge its arrows of light.

Starstorm
Calls down a wave of meteors to damage nearby enemy units. An enemy unit in close range will take a second hit for additional damage.

 Upgradeable by Aghanim's Scepter. Passively triggers every few seconds. The passive does not release a second meteor.
Sacred Arrow
Fires an arrow with deadly precision, dealing large damage and stunning the first enemy unit it strikes. Stun duration and bonus damage increase based on the distance the arrow has traveled. If the unit hit is a non-ancient creep, it is killed instead.
Leap
Mirana leaps forward into battle, empowering herself with attack and movement speed.
Moonlight Shadow
Turns Mirana and all allied heroes invisible. If invisibility is broken, it will restore after the fade time if the shadow's duration has not expired.
Mana Break
Attacks burn mana and deal part of the amount as damage. Illusions burn a reduced amount.
