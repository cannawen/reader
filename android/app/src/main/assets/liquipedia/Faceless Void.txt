Darkterror, the Faceless Void

Agility Hero

Darkterror the Faceless Void is a visitor from Claszureme, a realm outside of time. It remains a mystery why this being from another dimension believes the struggle for the Nemesis Stones is worth entering our physical plane, but apparently an upset in the balance of power in this world has repercussions in adjacent dimensions. Time means nothing to Darkterror, except as a way to thwart his foes and aid his allies. His long-view of the cosmos has given him a remote, disconnected quality, although in battle he is quite capable of making it personal.

Time Walk
Rushes to a target location while backtracking any recent damage taken.
Time Dilation
Faceless Void traps all nearby enemies in a time dilation field, freezing their cooldowns and slowing their movement and attack speed for each cooldown frozen.
Time Lock
Adds the chance for an attack to lock an enemy unit in time, stunning it and dealing bonus damage. The duration is twice as long against creeps.
Chronosphere

 Upgradeable by Aghanim's Scepter. Decreases the cooldown.
Backtrack
Faceless Void dodges backward in time, eluding damage from attacks and spells.
