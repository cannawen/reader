Yurnero, the Juggernaut

Agility Hero

No one has ever seen the face hidden beneath the mask of Yurnero the Juggernaut. It is only speculation that he even has one. For defying a corrupt lord, Yurnero was exiled from the ancient Isle of Masksâ€”a punishment that saved his life. The isle soon after vanished beneath the waves in a night of vengeful magic. He alone remains to carry on the Isle's long Juggernaut tradition, one of ritual and swordplay. The last practitioner of the art, Yurnero's confidence and courage are the result of endless practice; his inventive bladework proves that he has never stopped challenging himself. Still, his motives are as unreadable as his expression. For a hero who has lost everything twice over, he fights as if victory is a foregone conclusion.

Blade Fury
Causes a bladestorm of destructive force around Juggernaut, rendering him immune to magic and dealing damage to nearby enemy units.
Healing Ward
Summons a Healing Ward that heals all nearby allied units, based on their max hit points. The Healing Ward can move after being summoned.
Blade Dance
Gives Juggernaut a chance to deal increased damage on each attack.
Omnislash
Juggernaut leaps towards the target enemy unit with a damaging attack, and then slashes other nearby enemy units, dealing massive damage per slash. The fewer units available to attack, the more damage those units will take; if a unit is alone, it will take all of the damage. Kills creeps in a single hit. Juggernaut becomes invulnerable while Omnislashing.

 Upgradeable by Aghanim's Scepter. Increases the number of jumps and decreases the cooldown.
