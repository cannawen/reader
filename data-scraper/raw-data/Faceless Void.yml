heroName: Faceless Void
fullHeroName: 'Darkterror, the Faceless Void'
description:
  - >-
    Darkterror the Faceless Void is a visitor from Claszureme, a realm outside
    of time. It remains a mystery why this being from another dimension believes
    the struggle for the Nemesis Stones is worth entering our physical plane,
    but apparently an upset in the balance of power in this world has
    repercussions in adjacent dimensions. Time means nothing to Darkterror,
    except as a way to thwart his foes and aid his allies. His long-view of the
    cosmos has given him a remote, disconnected quality, although in battle he
    is quite capable of making it personal.
