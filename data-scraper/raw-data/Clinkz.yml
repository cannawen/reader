  - >-
    At the base of the Bleeding Hills stretches a thousand-league woodâ€”a place
    called The Hoven, where black pools gather the tarry blood of the uplands,
    and the king-mage Sutherex sits in benevolent rule. Once a sworn protector
    of the Hoven lands, Clinkz earned a reputation for his skill with a bow. In
    the three-hundredth year of the king-mage, the demon Maraxiform rose from
    sixth hell to lay claim to the forest. In response, the king-mage decried an
    unbreakable spell: to any who slew the demon would be granted Life Without
    End.

    Unaware of the spell, Clinkz waded into battle, defending his lands against
    the demon's fiery onslaught. Clinkz drove Maraxiform back to the gates of
    sixth-hell itself, where on that fiery threshold the two locked in a mortal
    conflict. Grievously wounded, the demon let out a blast of hellfire as
    Clinkz loosed his final arrow. The arrow struck the demon true as hellfire
    poured out across the land, lighting the black pools and burning Clinkz
    alive at the instant of the demon's death. Thus, the mage's spell took
    effect at the very moment of the archer's conflagration, preserving him in
    this unholy state, leaving him a being of bones and rage, caught in the very
    act of dying, carrying hell's breath with him on his journey into eternity.
