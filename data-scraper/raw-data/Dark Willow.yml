    Children love telling stories about the whimsical adventures of fairies...
    That's because children don't know that most fairies are spiteful jerks. And
    in the world of spiteful fairies there are few names spoken of with more
    contempt than Mireska Sunbreeze.
  - >-
    Born to a fae merchant king, Mireska grew up in Revtel; a cutthroat nation
    where manipulation and murder were the norm. But while she was quite adept
    at navigating the etiquette, unspoken laws, and social rituals that
    permeated every element of her life, she found the whole thing rather
    boring.
  - >-
    So, Mireska did what most rebellious children do: burn down her family
    estate and set off with her pet wisp Jex to live the life of a wandering
    grifter.
