heroName: Ancient Apparition
fullHeroName: 'Kaldr, the Ancient Apparition'
description:
  - >-
    Kaldr, the Ancient Apparition, is an image projected from outside time. He
    springs from the cold, infinite void that both predates the universe and
    awaits its end. Kaldr is, Kaldr was, Kaldr shall be...and what we perceive,
    powerful as it appears to us, is but the faintest faded echo of the true,
    eternal Kaldr. Some believe that as the cosmos ages and approaches its final
    moments, the brightness and power of Kaldr will also intensifyâ€”that the
    Ancient Apparition will grow younger and stronger as eternity's end draws
    nigh. His grip of ice will bring all matter to a stop, his image will cast a
    light too terrible to behold. An Apparition no longer!

abilityDescriptions:
  - >-
    Places a frozen hex on an enemy unit that deals damage over time, but can be
    dispelled by moving away from the initial cast point. If the enemy unit
    doesn't move outside of the given range, it will be stunned and frozen in
    place after a few seconds.
  - >-
    Creates a vortex of icy energy that slows movement speed and increases magic
    damage done in its range. Speeds up Ancient Apparition himself.
  - >-
    A frigid gust enchants allied heroes, granting them bonus magical damage for
    a given number of physical attacks while slowing their attack speed
    slightly. Ancient Apparition always receives the buff when cast even if he
    is not in the target area.

    On first use, Kaldr launches a tracer towards the targeted location. The
    second use stops the tracer and releases the projectile from Kaldr. The
    greater the distance, the larger the radius of the blast. It deals damage
    and applies a frostbite curse to units it touches, which prevents healing.
    Frostbitten units will take minor damage over time, and if the unit drops
    below the threshold they'll instantly shatter.

     Upgradeable by Aghanim's Scepter. Increases the duration.
  - Releases the ice blast to the tracer's current location.
