heroName: Windranger
fullHeroName: 'Lyralei, the Windranger'
description:
  - >-
    The western forests guard their secrets well. One of these is Lyralei,
    master archer of the wood, and favored godchild of the wind. Known now as
    Windranger, Lyralei's family was killed in a storm on the night of her
    birthâ€”their house blown down by the gale, contents scattered to the winds.
    Only the newborn survived among the debris field of death and destruction.
    In the quiet after the storm, the wind itself took notice of the lucky
    infant crying in the grass. The wind pitied the child and so lifted her into
    the sky and deposited her on a doorstep in a neighboring village. In the
    years that followed, the wind returned occasionally to the child's life,
    watching from a distance while she honed her skills. Now, after many years
    of training, Windranger fires her arrows true to their targets. She moves
    with blinding speed, as if hastened by a wind ever at her back. With a
    flurry of arrows, she slaughters her enemies, having become, nearly, a force
    of nature herself.

abilityDescriptions:
  - >-
    Shackles the target to an enemy unit or tree in a line directly behind it.
    If no secondary unit or tree is successfully latched on to, the stun
    duration is reduced.
  - >-
    Windranger charges her bow for a single powerful shot. The arrow deals
    damage to enemy units and destroys trees in its path. Damage is greatest on
    the first target, and reduces for each target it pierces after. If the
    channeling is cancelled early, the shot will still occur but deal less
    damage.
  - >-
    Increases movement speed and adds evasion from all physical attacks, while
    slowing the movement of nearby enemies.
  - >-
    Windranger channels the wind, gaining bonus attack speed against the chosen
    enemy unit or building, although with reduced damage.

     Upgradeable by Aghanim's Scepter. Reduces the self damage reduction and decreases the cooldown.
