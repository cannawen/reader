description:
  - >-
    Like many great poets, Auroth just wants time to write, but the Winter
    Wyvern's life is full of interruptions. The epics of the Eldwurms have a
    long and colorful history, but some fear that the remaining dragon scholars
    are not as prolific as they once were, with few lines added to the Eldwurm
    Eddas since the last age of greatness. Auroth laments: "We forget that there
    is more to life than triumph and dominion over enemies. We must also live
    our lives in the pursuit of creative expression." She embarks on research
    expeditions, collecting books for inspiration. But all this research can be
    terribly distracting, and she spends less time writing than she should.
    Although she knows she should be lurking in her lair, adding to the Eddas,
    she finds herself engaged in epic battles against powerful enemies. She
    loots castles, raids ancient libraries ... and if she happens to heap glory
    on herself in the process, she tells herself that it's merely a side effect
    of her research. The fact is, while her skill and power on the battlefield
    are legendary, her scholarly travails have thus far hardly been the stuff of
    literary acclaim. But she is not content to stand as a protagonist of heroic
    lore. She wishes also to create it.

abilityDescriptions:
  - >-
    Winter Wyvern soars upon an arctic wind, granting her unobstructed movement
    and allowing her to exhale a blistering chill into each attack. While
    soaring, her attacks travel further and faster, and slow enemies with a
    burning freeze that strips them of a percentage of their current health each
    second.

    Her sight is also hardened against night's chill, granting her additional
    vision range at night.

     Upgradeable by Aghanim's Scepter. Becomes a toggled ability.

    Launches a ball of brittle ice toward an enemy. The ice shatters on impact,
    leaving the primary target unaffected, while hurling damaging splinters into
    nearby enemies. Enemies struck by these splinters are slowed.
  - >-
    Encases an ally in an icy cocoon which heals a base amount as well as a
    percentage of their maximum health each second. The cocoon blocks all
    Physical damage.
  - >-
    Winter Wyvern freezes an enemy in place while striking those nearby with a
    maddening curse which causes them to attack their frozen ally with increased
    attack speed. Units affected by Winter's Curse are immune to damage from
    enemies.
