heroName: Pudge
fullHeroName: 'Pudge, the Butcher'
description:
  - >-
    In the Fields of Endless Carnage, far to the south of Quoidge, a corpulent
    figure works tirelessly through the nightâ€”dismembering, disembowelling,
    piling up the limbs and viscera of the fallen that the battlefield might be
    clear by dawn. In this cursed realm, nothing can decay or decompose; no
    corpse may ever return to the earth from which it sprang, no matter how deep
    you dig the grave. Flocked by carrion birds who need him to cut their meals
    into beak-sized chunks, Pudge the Butcher hones his skills with blades that
    grow sharper the longer he uses them. Swish, swish, thunk. Flesh falls from
    the bone; tendons and ligaments part like wet paper. And while he always had
    a taste for the butchery, over the ages, Pudge has developed a taste for its
    byproduct as well. Starting with a gobbet of muscle here, a sip of blood
    there... before long he was thrusting his jaws deep into the toughest of
    torsos, like a dog gnawing at rags. Even those who are beyond fearing the
    Reaper, fear the Butcher.

abilityDescriptions:
  - >-
    Launches a bloody hook at a unit or location. The hook will snag the first
    unit it encounters, dragging the unit back to Pudge and dealing damage and a
    mini-stun if it is an enemy.

     Upgradeable by Aghanim's Scepter. Increases the damage and decreases the cooldown.
  - >-
    A toxic cloud that deals intense damage and slows movement. It harms enemy
    units and Pudge himself.
  - >-
    Gives Pudge bonus magic resistance, as well as bonus strength that increases
    each time Pudge kills an enemy Hero or it dies in his vicinity. Flesh Heap
    is retroactive and will gain charges before it is skilled, which will become
    active once the ability is finally skilled.
  - >-
    Pudge chows down on an enemy unit, disabling it, pulling it closer to
    himself and dealing damage over time, and healing himself by the damage
    done.
