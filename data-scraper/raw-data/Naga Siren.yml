heroName: Naga Siren
fullHeroName: 'Slithice, the Naga Siren'
description:
  - >-
    Among the high-sworn of the Slithereen Guard there is a solemn vow oft
    repeated before battle: No Slithereen may fail. In truth, these words are
    equal parts oath and enforceable covenant, for those who fall short of their
    duty are banished from the order. To fail is to be other than Slithereen.
  - >-
    Once most highly esteemed of her race, Slithice for many years commanded a
    battalion of her fellows, using her formidable voice as her greatest weapon.
    Powerful, sinuous, serpentine, she led her deadly Guard in defense of the
    Deep Ones, and the great wealth of the sunken cities. But in the final
    battle of Crey, her forces were driven back by a marauding army of levianths
    intent on finding tribute for their god Maelrawn. After the long and bloody
    onslaught, as the bodies were cleared from the sunken halls, a single
    jeweled chalice was found missing from the trove. Of her hundred Guard, only
    a handful survived, but their bravery and sacrifice were of little
    consequence. What mattered was that treasure was taken. Honor destroyed. And
    so Naga Siren was cast out. Banished to search for the stolen chalice.
    Though she might add a hundred times her weight to the golden trove, she is
    doomed to live apart until that day she returns that which was taken. For no
    amount of gold is equal in honor to the honor she lost.
