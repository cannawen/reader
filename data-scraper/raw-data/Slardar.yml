heroName: Slardar
fullHeroName: 'Slardar, the Slithereen Guard'
description:
  - >-
    Slardar is a Slithereen, one of the Deep Ones, guardian of the great wealth
    of sunken cities and the ancient riches buried there. In the lightless gulf
    of the great ocean abysses, the Slithereen Guard carries his lure-light with
    him through the secret treasure rooms. Subaqueous thieves (sent into the
    deeps by covetous dryland sorcerers) are drawn in by its friendly glow,
    never to return. He is utterly loyal, and his taciturn nature hides deep
    knowledge of the most secret places of the sea. He rises to the shallows in
    spite of the pain caused him by brightness, to commit reconnaissance, to
    make sure no one is conspiring against the depths, and sometimes in
    relentless pursuit of the rare few who manage to steal off with an item from
    the Sunken Treasury. Because he has spent his whole life at great pressure,
    under tremendous weight of the sea, Slardar the Slithereen Guard is a
    creature of great power.
