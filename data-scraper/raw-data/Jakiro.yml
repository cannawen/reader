heroName: Jakiro
fullHeroName: 'Jakiro, the Twin Head Dragon'
description:
  - >-
    Even among magical beasts, a twin-headed dragon is a freak. Equal parts ice
    and fire, cunning and rage, the creature known as Jakiro glides over charred
    and ice-bound battlefields, laying waste to any who would bear arms against
    it. Pyrexae dragon clutches always contain two fledglings. Famous for their
    viciousness even from the first moments of life, newly hatched dragons of
    this species will try to kill their sibling while still in the nest. Only
    the strongest survive. In this way is the strength of the Pyrexae line
    ensured. By some accident of nature, the freak Jakiro hatched from a single
    egg, combining in a single individual the full range of abilities found
    within the diverse Pyrexae species. Trapped within the armature of its
    monstrous body, the powers of ice and fire combine, and now no enemy is
    safe.
