fullHeroName: 'Demnok Lannik, the Warlock'
description:
  - >-
    As Chief Curator and Head of Acquisitions for the Arcane Archives of the
    Ultimyr Academy, Demnok Lannik was tireless in his pursuit of lost, rare and
    forbidden tomes. No cursed temple was so foreboding, no cavern path so
    treacherous, that any concern for his own survival could dissuade him from
    entering if rumors hinted that some pamphlet of primordial lore might still
    survive in its depths. However, so often did his investigations trigger the
    wrath of protector entities, that he finally found it necessary to master
    the arts of magic. He bent himself to learning sorcery with the same
    thorough obsessiveness that marked his quest for incunabula, becoming the
    most powerful Warlock of the Academy in less time than most practitioners
    required to complete a course of undergraduate work. Almost as an
    afterthought, he carved a staff of Dreadwood and summoned into it a captive
    spirit from the Outer Hells. And anticipating the day when he will have
    recovered every last lost spellbook, he has commenced writing his own Black
    Grimoire. It will undoubtedly be instructive.
