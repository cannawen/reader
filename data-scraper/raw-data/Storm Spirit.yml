fullHeroName: 'Raijin Thunderkeg, the Storm Spirit'
description:
  - >-
    Storm Spirit is literally a force of nature—the wild power of wind and
    weather, bottled in human form. And a boisterous, jovial, irrepressible form
    it is! As jolly as a favorite uncle, he injects every scene with crackling
    energy. But it was not always thus, and there was tragedy in his creation.
    Generations ago, in the plains beyond the Wailing Mountains, a good people
    lay starving in drought and famine. A simple elementalist, Thunderkeg by
    name, used a forbidden spell to summon the spirit of the storm, asking for
    rain. Enraged at this mortal's presumption, the Storm Celestial known as
    Raijin lay waste to the land, scouring it bare with winds and flood.
    Thunderkeg was no match for the Celestial—at least until he cast a suicidal
    spell that forged their fates into one: he captured the Celestial in the
    cage of his own body. Trapped together, Thunderkeg's boundless good humor
    fused with Raijin's crazed energy, creating the jovial Raijin Thunderkeg, a
    Celestial who walks the world in physical form.
