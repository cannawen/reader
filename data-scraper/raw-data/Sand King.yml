heroName: Sand King
fullHeroName: 'Crixalis, the Sand King'
description:
  - >-
    The sands of the Scintillant Waste are alive and sentient—the whole vast
    desert speaks to itself, thinking thoughts only such a vastness can
    conceive. But when it needs must find a form to communicate with those of
    more limited scope, it frees a fragment of itself, and fills a carapace of
    magic armor formed by the cunning Djinn of Qaldin. This essential identity
    calls itself Crixalis, meaning 'Soul of the Sand,' but others know it as
    Sand King. Sand King takes the form of a huge arachnid, inspired by the
    Scintillant Waste's small but ubiquitous denizens; and this is a true
    outward expression of his ferocious nature. Guardian, warrior,
    ambassador—Sand King is all of these things, inseparable from the endless
    desert that gave him life.
