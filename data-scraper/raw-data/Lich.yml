heroName: Lich
fullHeroName: 'Ethreain, the Lich'
description:
  - >-
    In life, the frost-mage Ethreain (not yet a Lich) had used the threat of
    destructive ice to enslave entire kingdoms. His subjects, aided by a few
    desperate magicians, eventually grew bold enough to ambush him. Armed with
    enough charmed rope to bind him forever, they tied the frost mage to adamant
    weights and dropped him in a pool known chiefly for being bottomless. It
    wasn't. He only fell for a year or so before an outcrop snagged him. There
    he rested, dead but undecaying, until the geomancer Anhil thought to verify
    the legend of the supposedly bottomless Black Pool. Anhil's plumbline
    snarled with the ropes that bound the drowned magician, and up he hauled an
    unexpected prize. Thinking that by rendering the dead undead, he could
    question the Lich about the properties of the pool, he removed the bindings
    and commenced a simple rite of resurrection. Even the descendants of
    Ethreain's enemies were long forgotten by time, so there were none to warn
    Anhil against imprudence. But he learned the error of his judgement almost
    immediately, as Lich threw off the shackles and consumed him.
