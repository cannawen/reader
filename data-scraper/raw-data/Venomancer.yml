  - >-
    In the Acid Jungles of Jidi Isle, poison runs in the veins and bubbles in
    the guts of every creature that scuttles, climbs or swoops between
    fluorescent vines dripping with caustic sap. Yet even in this toxic
    menagerie, Venomancer is acknowledged as the most venomous. Ages ago, an
    Herbalist named Lesale crossed the Bay of Fradj by coracle, searching for
    potent essences that might be extracted from bark and root, and found
    instead a nightmare transformation. Two leagues into Jidi's jungle, Lesale
    encountered a reptile camouflaged as an epiphyte, which stung him as he
    mistakenly plucked it. In desperation, he used his partial knowledge of the
    jungle's herbal bounty, mixing the venom of the (swiftly throttled) reptile
    with the nectar of an armored orchid, to compound an antidote. In the
    moments before a black paralysis claimed him completely, he injected himself
    by orchid-thorn, and instantly fell into a coma. Seventeen years later,
    something stirred in the spot where he had fallen, throwing off the years'
    accumulation of humus: Venomancer. Lesale the Herbalist no longer—but Lesale
    the Deathbringer. His mind was all but erased, and his flesh had been
    consumed and replaced by a new type of matter—one fusing the venom of the
    reptile with the poisonous integument of the orchid. Jidi's Acid Jungles
    knew a new master, one before whom even the most vicious predators soon
    learned to bow or burrow for their lives. The lurid isle proved too
    confining, and some human hunger deep in the heart of the Venomancer drove
    Lesale out in search of new poisons—and new deaths to bring.
