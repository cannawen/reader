heroName: Io
fullHeroName: 'Io, the Wisp'
description:
  - >-
    Io is everywhere, and in all things. Denounced by enemies as the great
    unmaker, worshiped by scholars as the twinkling of a divine eye, this
    strange Wisp of life-force occupies all planes at once, the merest fraction
    of its being crossing into physical existence at any one moment.
  - >-
    Like the great twin riders Dark and Light, and yet another ancient traveler
    whose true history is lost to the ages, Io the Wisp is a Fundamental of the
    universeâ€”a force older than time, a wanderer from realms far beyond mortal
    understanding. Io is nothing less than the sum of all attractive and
    repulsive forces within the material field, a sentient manifestation of the
    charge that bind particles together. It is only in the controlled warping of
    these forces that Io's presence can be experienced on the physical plane. A
    benevolent, cooperative force, Io bonds its strange magnetism to others so
    that the power of allies might be enhanced. Its motives inscrutable, its
    strength unimaginable, Io moves through the physical plane, the perfect
    expression of the mysteries of the universe.

abilityDescriptions:
  - >-
    Io tethers to an allied unit, granting both Io and the tethered ally bonus
    movement speed. While tethered, the health and mana Io regenerates is
    restored to the tethered ally. Any enemy unit that crosses the tether is
    slowed. Io may also cancel the tether at any time with the Break Tether
    ability.
  - Breaks the link to the tethered unit.
  - >-
    Summons five spirits that dance in a circle around Io, damaging any enemies
    they hit. If a spirit hits an enemy hero, it explodes, damaging all enemy
    units in an area around it. Creeps take minor damage from touching a spirit,
    but will not cause them to explode.
  - Calls the spirits closer to Io.
  - Sends the spirits farther away from Io.
  - >-
    Io gains bonus attack speed and incoming damage reduction, at the cost of
    draining hp and mana per second.


    If Io is Tethered to an ally, they also gain the bonuses.
  - >-
    Teleports Io and its Tethered ally to any location on the map. After the
    spell expires, Io along with any tethered ally will return to the initial
    teleportation location.
