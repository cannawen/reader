heroName: Underlord
fullHeroName: 'Vrogros, the Underlord'
description:
  - Neither myth nor song exist to tell of their coming.
  - >-
    Deep below the surface of the world lay unknown wonders and horrors. Down
    and down again, well beneath the slithering magma fields and simmering roots
    of dormant volcanoes stands the obsidian city of Aziyog, its incomparable
    stonework spanning an endless cavern. Within honeycomb walls mortared with
    the bones of countless slaves lies the domain of the Abyssal Horde, and
    their brutal underlord Vrogros.
  - >-
    Armed by the monstrous forgemasters of his kind and well-practiced in the
    arts of the Dark Rift, Vrogros is able to conjure forth flame and crippling
    malice through the twist between worlds. He seeks always to expand his
    holdings, destroying or enslaving all he encounters. Yet the lands offered
    by the subterranean realm are few, and so his sights have turned upward. By
    his command the first waves of abyssal invaders have already marched through
    the rift, a few doomed legions meant merely to test the might of nations
    above. Now, as his full force readies itself for unending conquest, Vrogros
    himself steps into a sunlit world to announce his coming reign. Those who
    face the Underlord will bow and pay tribute, or be crushed where they stand.

abilityDescriptions:
  - >-
    Calls down waves of fire that damage enemy units in the target area, burning
    for additional damage over time.
  - >-
    A deadly pit is conjured at the target location. Any unit that enters is
    rooted by malefic forces.
  - >-
    Nearby enemy units are weakened, losing a portion of their base damage. If a
    unit dies while under this effect, Underlord gains bonus damage.

     Upgradeable by Aghanim's Scepter. Grants nearby allied heroes half of the damage bonus and increases the duration the bonus lasts.
  - >-
    Opens a dark rift at the targeted friendly unit's position. After a short
    delay, Underlord and all nearby friendly heroes are teleported to that
    unit's location. Dark Rift can be cancelled at anytime during the cast. If
    it is cancelled in this way or the target unit dies before the spell becomes
    active, Dark Rift goes into cooldown.
  - Stop the teleport.
