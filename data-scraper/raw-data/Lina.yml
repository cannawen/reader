fullHeroName: 'Lina, the Slayer'
description:
  - >-
    The sibling rivalries between Lina the Slayer, and her younger sister Rylai,
    the Crystal Maiden, were the stuff of legend in the temperate region where
    they spent their quarrelsome childhoods together. Lina always had the
    advantage, however, for while Crystal was guileless and naive, Lina's fiery
    ardor was tempered by cleverness and conniving. The exasperated parents of
    these incompatible offspring went through half a dozen homesteads, losing
    one to fire, the next to ice, before they realized life would be simpler if
    the children were separated. As the oldest, Lina was sent far south to live
    with a patient aunt in the blazing Desert of Misrule, a climate that proved
    more than comfortable for the fiery Slayer. Her arrival made quite an
    impression on the somnolent locals, and more than one would-be suitor
    scorched his fingers or went away with singed eyebrows, his advances
    spurned. Lina is proud and confident, and nothing can dampen her flame.
