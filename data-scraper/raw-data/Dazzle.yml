fullHeroName: 'Dazzle, the Shadow Priest'
description:
  - >-
    Each young acolyte to the Dezun order must complete a series of rites before
    becoming a shadow priest. The final rite, the rite of shades, is a harrowing
    spiritual journey through the Nothl Realm, an unpredictable domain from
    which not all visitants return. Of those who do, some return mad. Others
    return with strange aptitudes. But all who go there are changed by their
    experiences. Driven by the need for enlightenment, Dazzle was the youngest
    of his tribe ever to request the sacred ritual. At first the order refused
    him, saying he was too young. But Dazzle was not to be dissuaded. Sensing
    something special in the headstrong young acolyte, the elders relented.
    Dazzle drank down the sacred potion and sat by the fire while the rest of
    his tribe danced through the night. In this ethereal dimension of the Nothl
    Realm, the properties of light and dark are inverted. Thus his brilliant
    healing light, beautiful to our eye, is actually a sinister kind of evil;
    and the darkest deeds are done in a dazzling glow. The elders' intuition was
    prophetic: Dazzle returned to his people as a Shadow Priest like none seen
    before, with the power to heal as well as to destroy. Now he uses his gift
    to cut down his enemies and mend his friends.
