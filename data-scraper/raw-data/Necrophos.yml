heroName: Necrophos
fullHeroName: 'Rotund''jere, the Necrophos'
description:
  - >-
    In a time of great plague, an obscure monk of dark inclinations, one
    Rotund'jere, found himself promoted to the rank of Cardinal by the swift
    death of all his superiors. While others of the order went out to succor the
    ill, the newly ordained cardinal secluded himself within the Cathedral of
    Rumusque, busily scheming to acquire the property of dying nobles, promising
    them spiritual rewards if they signed over their terrestrial domains. As the
    plague receded to a few stubborn pockets, his behavior came to the attention
    of the greater order, which found him guilty of heresy and sentenced him to
    serve in the plague ward, ensorcelled with spells that would ensure him a
    slow and lingering illness. But they had not counted on his natural
    immunity. Rotund'jere caught the pox, but instead of dying, found it feeding
    his power, transforming him into a veritable plague-mage, a Pope of
    Pestilence. Proclaiming himself Necrophos, he travels the world, spreading
    plague wherever he goes, and growing in terrible power with every village
    his pestilential presence obliterates.

abilityDescriptions:
  - >-
    Necrophos releases a wave of death around him, dealing damage to enemy units
    and healing allied units. Passively provides HP and MP regeneration to
    Necrophos for each unit killed. Gives 6Ã— the bonus for hero kills.
  - >-
    Necrophos turns ethereal and emits a slow aura that reduces enemy movement
    speed. While Necrophos is in this form, he takes additional magic damage but
    any health or mana regeneration he receives is amplified.
  - >-
    Necrophos stills the hearts of his opponents, causing nearby enemy units to
    lose a percentage of their max health over time.
  - >-
    Stuns the target enemy hero, then deals damage based on how much life it is
    missing. Heroes killed by Reaper's Scythe take longer to respawn.

     Upgradeable by Aghanim's Scepter. Decreases the cooldown.
