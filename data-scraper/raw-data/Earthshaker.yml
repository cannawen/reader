fullHeroName: 'Raigor Stonehoof, the Earthshaker'
description:
  - >-
    Like a golem or gargoyle, Earthshaker was one with the earth but now walks
    freely upon it. Unlike those other entities, he created himself through an
    act of will, and serves no other master. In restless slumbers, encased in a
    deep seam of stone, he became aware of the life drifting freely above him.
    He grew curious. During a season of tremors, the peaks of Nishai shook
    themselves loose of avalanches, shifting the course of rivers and turning
    shallow valleys into bottomless chasms. When the land finally ceased
    quaking, Earthshaker stepped from the settling dust, tossing aside massive
    boulders as if throwing off a light blanket. He had shaped himself in the
    image of a mortal beast, and named himself Raigor Stonehoof. He bleeds now,
    and breathes, and therefore he can die. But his spirit is still that of the
    earth; he carries its power in the magical totem that never leaves him. And
    on the day he returns to dust, the earth will greet him as a prodigal son.
