fullHeroName: 'Atropos, the Bane Elemental'
description:
  - >-
    When the gods have nightmares, it is Bane Elemental who brings them. Also
    known as Atropos, Bane was born from the midnight terrors of the goddess
    Nyctasha. A force of terror too powerful to be contained by sleep, he
    surfaced from her slumbers, fed upon her immortality, and stole his vaporous
    form from her inky blood. He is the essence of fear. Mortals who hear his
    voice hear their darkest secrets whispered in their ear. He calls to the
    hidden fear in every Hero's heart. Wakefulness is no protection, for Bane's
    black blood, continuously dripping, is a tar that traps his enemies in
    nightmare. In the presence of Bane, every Hero remembers to fear the dark.
