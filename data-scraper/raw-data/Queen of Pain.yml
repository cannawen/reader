heroName: Queen of Pain
fullHeroName: 'Akasha, the Queen of Pain'
description:
  - >-
    The Ecclesiast-King of Elze nursed a desire for pain—forbidden pain. In a
    less prominent political figure, such desires might be considered unwise,
    but in a monarch of his stature, to satisfy such thirsts would have
    threatened the virtue of the Divine Throne itself. Therefore he turned to
    his dungeon full of demonologists, promising freedom to whoever could summon
    a personal succubus of torment and bind it entirely to his service. The
    creature who arrived, Akasha by name, visited upon him such exquisite
    torments that he named her his Secret Queen, and he began to spend all his
    spare moments submitting to her clever torments—eventually abdicating all
    his responsibilities in his pursuit of the painful pleasures that only she
    could bring. Queen of Pain could bring him to the brink of death, but she
    was rune-bound to keep him alive. At last the King's neglect of state
    brought on an uprising. He was dragged from his chamber and hurled from the
    Tower of Invocations, and at the moment of death, Queen of Pain was let
    loose into the world, freed from servitude—freed to visit her sufferings on
    anyone she deigned to notice.
