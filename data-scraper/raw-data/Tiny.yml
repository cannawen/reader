heroName: Tiny
fullHeroName: 'Tiny, the Stone Giant'
description:
  - >-
    Coming to life as a chunk of stone, Tiny's origins are a mystery on which he
    continually speculates. He is a Stone Giant now, but what did he used to be?
    A splinter broken from a Golem's heel? A shard swept from a
    gargoyle-sculptor's workshop? A fragment of the Oracular Visage of Garthos?
    A deep curiosity drives him, and he travels the world tirelessly seeking his
    origins, his parentage, his people. As he roams, he gathers weight and size;
    the forces that weather lesser rocks, instead cause Tiny to grow and ever
    grow.

  - Tree Throw
  - Grow
abilityDescriptions:
  - 'Bombards an area with rocks, stunning and damaging enemy land units.'
  - >-
    Grabs the unit closest to Tiny, friend or enemy, and launches it at the
    target unit to deal damage where they land. If the tossed unit is an enemy,
    it will take extra damage.
  - >-
    Grabs a tree to whack enemies with for a limited number of times. Grants
    bonus attack range. Attacks deal more damage (increased vs. buildings) and
    fully splash on units along the way. The tree can be thrown expending all
    the charges, to deal your attack to a unit at distance.
  - >-
    Consume the remaining Tree Grab charges and throws the tree, proccing your
    attack and splashing damage around the impact.
  - Tiny gains craggy mass that increases his power at the cost of attack speed.
