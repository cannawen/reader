description:
  - >-
    How had she been reduced to this? She was once the Scourge of the Plains, a
    merciless leader of men and beasts, and able to sow terror wherever she
    dared. Now she was far from her homeland, driven half mad from starvation
    and months of wandering, her army long dead or turned to worse. As she stood
    at the edge of an ancient forest, a pair of glowing eyes spied on from an
    elder branch. Something beautiful and deadly sought a meal in the wilting
    dusk. Without a sound, it turned and left. Fury overtook her. Clutching a
    rust-eaten dagger, she charged after the beast determined to reclaim even a
    shred of her past glory, but her quarry would not be caught. Three times she
    cornered the creature among the rocks and trees, and three times she pounced
    only to witness its fading shadow darting further into the woods. Yet the
    full moon shone brightly, and the creature's trail was easy to follow.
    Arriving in a clearing atop a high hill, the beast's massive feline form sat
    in the open, attentive and waiting. When the woman brandished her dagger,
    the creature reared and roared and charged. Death, it seemed, had come for
    her at long last in this strange place. She stood, calm and ready. A flash
    of movement, and the beast snatched the dagger from her hand before
    vanishing into the forest. Stillness. Hooded figures approached. In reverent
    tones they revealed that Selemene, Goddess of the Moon, had chosen her, had
    guided her, had tested her. Unwittingly she had endured the sacred rites of
    the Dark Moon, warriors of the Nightsilver Woods.
  - >-
    She was offered a choice: join the Dark Moon and pledge herself to the
    service of Selemene, or leave and never return. She did not hesitate.
    Embracing her absolution, she renounced her bloody past, and took up a new
    mantle as Luna of the Dark Moon, the dreaded Moon Rider, ruthless and
    ever-loyal guardian of the Nightsilver Woods.
