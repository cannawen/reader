description:
  - >-
    The veteran of countless battles on a thousand worlds, Chaos Knight hails
    from a far upstream plane where the fundamental laws of the universe have
    found sentient expression. Of all the ancient Fundamentals, he is the oldest
    and most tirelessâ€”endlessly searching out a being he knows only as "The
    Light." Long ago the Light ventured out from the progenitor realm, in
    defiance of the first covenant. Now Chaos Knight shifts from plane to plane,
    always on the hunt to extinguish the Light wherever he finds it. A thousand
    times he has snuffed out the source, and always he slides into another plane
    to continue his search anew.
  - >-
    Upon his steed Armageddon he rides, wading into battle with maniacal frenzy,
    drawing strength from the disorder of the universe. A physical manifestation
    of chaos itself, in times of need he calls upon other versions of himself
    from other planes, and together these dark horsemen ride into battle, as
    unstoppable as any force of nature. Only when the last Light of the world is
    scoured from existence will the search be ended. Where rides the Chaos
    Knight, death soon follows.
