    Long before the first words of the first histories there rose the druidic
    Bear Clan. Wise and just they were, and focused in their ways to seek an
    understanding of the natural order. The arch forces of nature saw this, and
    so sought the most learned among them. Wise old Sylla, clan justiciar and
    seer, stepped forward for his kin, and to him was given the Seed with these
    words: 'When all of the world has dimmed, when civilization has left these
    lands, when the world is slain and wracked by the endless deserts at the end
    of ages, plant the Seed.' As he grasped his trust, Sylla felt his years
    recede and his vitality returned. Vast knowledge burst into his mind. He
    found himself able to project his very will into reality and, with some
    concentration, alter his own physical form as well. Yet subtle whispers and
    cruel ears brought word of the Seed and its power to other peoples, and a
    terrible war crashed upon the Bear Clan. As his ancestral home burned, Sylla
    took his burden and fled to the wild places. Ages passed, and time and myth
    forgot the Bear Clan, forgot Sylla and the Seed, forgot wondrous
    civilizations that rose and fell in Bear Clan's wake. For millennia Sylla
    has waited, waited for word from his deities, waited for peace to come to
    the ever warring realms, waited in exile and in secret for the end of all
    things and for the conclusion of his sacred commitment, preparing himself
    always to face and destroy whatever would dare threaten his purpose.

    Demolish. Spirit Bear does not benefit from attributes.
