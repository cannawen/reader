description:
  - >-
    High on the wind-ravaged steppes of Druud, a gifted young stormcrafter
    called Disruptor was the first to unlock the secrets of the summer squalls.
    Constantly under assault from both seasonal storms and encroachment from
    civilized kingdoms to the South, the upland Oglodi have for centuries
    struggled to subsist atop the endless tablelands. They are the fractured
    remnant of a once-great civilization—a fallen tribe, their stormcraft
    strange and inscrutable, cobbled together from scraps of lost knowledge
    which even they no longer fully understand. For those on the high plain,
    weather has become a kind of religion, worshiped as both the giver and taker
    of life. But the electrical storms that bring life-sustaining rains arrive
    at a cost, and many are the charred and smoking corpses left in their wake.

    Although small for his kind, Disruptor is fearless, and driven by an
    insatiable curiosity. As a youth, while still unblooded and without a
    stryder, he explored the ruins of the ancestral cities—searching through
    collapsed and long-moldering libraries, rummaging through rusting
    manufactories. He took what he needed and returned to his tribe. Adapting a
    coil of ancient design, he harnessed the power of electrical differential
    and now calls down the thunder whenever he wishes. Part magic, part
    craftsmanship, his coils hold in their glowing plates the power of life and
    death—a power wielded with precision against the landed castes to the South,
    and any interlopers who cross into ancient Oglodi lands.
