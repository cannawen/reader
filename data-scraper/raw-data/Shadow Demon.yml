    Among the sovereign Demons with explicit access to this world, Doom scarcely
    bothers with the affairs of Noninfernals and Lesser Spectral Consorts, while
    Shadow Fiend passes through almost exclusively on collecting expeditions.
    The Shadow Demon, however, has always taken a deep and abiding interest in
    the material plane, as if sensing that mastery of this gritty dimensional
    nexus might be the key to total domination of all realities. Summoned first
    by minor wizards, the Shadow Demon granted every wish and put on
    increasingly impressive displays of power until he had the full attention of
    the greatest demonologists, and through them the various lords, tyrants,
    autarchs and heirophants who depended on sorcery to buttress their mundane
    power. So great was his deception that all his summoners considered
    themselves the master and Shadow Demon the servant; meanwhile, he eroded
    their identities and made their minds his own. In the end, most members of
    the cult were hollow puppets, extensions of his evil will. What Shadow
    Demon's next step would have been remains open to speculation, for around
    this time, Nevermore the Shadow Fiend bit into a particularly nasty-tasting
    soul and discovered that it held nothing but a foul nougat of Shadow Demon's
    essence. Alerted that a coup was underway, and that the ancient equilibrium
    of the Umbral Pact was about to be destabilized, Doom and Shadow Fiend
    briefly joined forces to destroy the burgeoning cult. Combining spells of
    incredible force, they undid Shadow Demon's centuries of patient work,
    reducing his cult to smithereensâ€”and all its members to a bloody splatter.
    Nothing remained except a tiny speck of demon shadow. Immortal and
    irreducible, this mote of evil was enough to seed the Shadow Demon's next
    scheme, and in fits and starts, over further centuries, he began to regroup.
    Whatever that speck of shadow touched, it tainted, and its influence
    gradually grew. A chaos of damaged parts pulled together, reknit, and
    combined to give Shadow Demon a form even stronger than his former. He is
    all but complete now, and his plan for infinite dominion lacks all of its
    former weaknesses. It would seem that such a being of pure malice and
    malevolence, a threat to all creation, would be forever out of place in our
    world...yet Shadow Demon does not lack for followers.
