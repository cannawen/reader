description:
  - >-
    Alone across an untouched darkness gleamed the Keeper's first sun, a
    singular point of conscious light fated to spread warmth into the empty
    void. Through aeons beyond count, this blinding beacon set to coalescing its
    incalculable energy before bursting forth the cataclysmic flare of
    supernova. From this inferno raced new beacons, star progeny identical to
    its parent, who journeyed an unlit ocean and settled in constellatory array.
    In time, they too would be made to propagate through supernova flame. So
    would this dazzling cycle of birth and rebirth repeat until all skies hewn
    of Titan toil deigned to twinkle and shine.
  - >-
    By this ageless crucible the star that mortals would come to call Phoenix
    collapsed into being, and like its ancestors was thrust into an endless
    cosmos to find a place among its stellar brethren. Yet curiosity toward that
    which the dimming elders comfort in the darkness consumed the fledgling, and
    so over long cycles it inquired and studied. It learned that among worlds
    both whole and broken would soon stir a nexus of remarkable variety locked
    in an enduring conflict of cosmic consequence, a plane which would find
    itself in need of more influence than a dying sun's distant rays could
    provide. Thus this infant son of suns took terrestrial form, eagerly
    travelling to shine its warmth upon those who may need it most, and perhaps
    seize upon its solar destiny.

abilityDescriptions:
  - >-
    Phoenix dives forward in an arc with a fixed distance in the targeted
    direction, dealing damage over time and slowing any units it comes into
    contact with, and then orbiting back to its original position.
  - Ends the dive.
  - >-
    Summons fire spirits that circle around Phoenix. Each spirit is launched one
    at a time at the targeted radius. Affected enemy units take damage over time
    and have their attack speed greatly reduced.
  - Target a fire spirit towards a location.
  - >-
    Drawing from its own inner fire, Phoenix expels a huge beam of light at the
    cost of its own life energy. The beam damages enemies for a percentage of
    their max hp and heals allies for half the amount.
  - Ends the sun ray.
  - >-
    Phoenix slowly drifts forward in the direction of the Sun Ray. Immune to
    slows while drifting, and gains flying movement.
  - >-
    The Phoenix willingly ends its current life for the chance to be reborn.
    Transforms into a burning sun that scorches enemies within a large radius.
    The sun can be attacked by enemy heroes; if it is destroyed, Phoenix dies as
    well. However, if the sun survives all enemies in range will be stunned and
    Phoenix will return to life fully regenerated.

     Upgradeable by Aghanim's Scepter. Increases the sun's health and can be cast on allies.
