heroName: Puck
fullHeroName: 'Puck, the Faerie Dragon'
description:
  - >-
    While Puck seems at first glance a mischievous, childish character, this
    quality masks an alien personality. The juvenile form of a Faerie Dragon, a
    creature that lives for eons, Puck spends countless millennia in its
    childish form. So while it is technically true that Puck is juvenile, it
    will continue to be so when the cities of the present age have sloughed away
    into dust. Its motives are therefore inscrutable, and what appears to be
    play may in fact hide a darker purpose. Its endless fondness for mischief is
    the true indicator of Puck's true nature.
