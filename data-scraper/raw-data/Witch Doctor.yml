heroName: Witch Doctor
fullHeroName: 'Zharvakko, the Witch Doctor'
description:
  - >-
    A wiry silhouette hitches forward—uneven of feature and limb, bizarre of
    gait, relentlessly criss-crossing the battlefield in search of that vital
    weak point where his talents can do most good, and most harm. Whether broken
    or mismade it is not clear, but still, none can doubt the power carried in
    his twisted physique. A long staff thumps the earth as Zharvakko the Witch
    Doctor advances, deploying a terrifying arsenal of fetishes, hexes and
    spells. It is a body of magical knowledge learned and perfected over several
    lifetimes in the island highlands of Arktura, now wielded with precision
    accuracy against his enemies. Zharvakko can be your best friend or your
    worst enemy—healing allies and laying waste to all who oppose him.
