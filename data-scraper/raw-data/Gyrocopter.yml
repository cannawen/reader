  - >-
    After serving through a lifetime of wars, upheaval, riots, and revolutions,
    the brass figured Aurel had seen enough. But in addition to a few trinkets
    and his considerable pension, the erstwhile engineer left with something far
    more interesting: a long-forgotten, incomplete schematic for a Gyrocopter,
    the world's first manned, non-magical flying device. Retiring to the
    tropical obscurity of the Ash Archipelago with little else but time and
    money, he set to work building the device. As the years wore on and the
    remains of failed prototypes began to pile up, he began to wonder if
    mechanical flight was even possible. A decade and a day after his
    retirement, on a sunny afternoon with a southerly breeze, Aurel sat in his
    latest attempt bristling with indignation and expectant failure. With a
    grunt of effort he pulled the ignition cord and covered his head, waiting
    for the inevitable explosion. However to his great surprise he began to lift
    and, following a few panicked adjustments, stabilize. Within an hour, he was
    ducking and weaving with the breeze, level with the gulls, and Aurel found
    himself filled with the breathless wonder of flight. As dusk settled in he
    set a course back to his workshop, but no sooner had he turned his craft
    when a cannonball tore through his tailfin. Disentangling himself from the
    wreckage, he swam toward the nearest piece of land in sight, and cursed to
    see the ship responsible for the cannonball collecting the debris. Days
    later, when Aurel returned to his workshop, he set to work on yet another
    gyrocopter, this one capable of carrying a much heavier, more dangerous
    payload.
