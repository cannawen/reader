description:
  - >-
    Karroch was born a child of the stocks. His mother died in childbirth; his
    father, a farrier for the Last King of Slom, was trampled to death when he
    was five. Afterward Karroch was indentured to the king's menagerie, where he
    grew up among all the beasts of the royal court: lions, apes, fell-deer, and
    things less known, things barely believed in. When the lad was seven, an
    explorer brought in a beast like none before seen. Dragged before the King
    in chains, the beast spoke, though its mouth moved not. Its words: a plea
    for freedom. The King only laughed and ordered the beast perform for his
    amusement; and when it refused, struck it with the Mad Scepter and ordered
    it dragged to the stocks.

    Over the coming months, the boy Karroch sneaked food and medicinal draughts
    to the wounded creature, but only managed to slow its deterioration.
    Wordlessly, the beast spoke to the boy, and over time their bond
    strengthened until the boy found he could hold up his end of a conversation.
    He could, in fact, speak now to all the creatures of the King's menagerie.
    On the night the beast died, a rage came over the boy. He incited the
    animals of the court to rebel and threw open their cages to set them amok on
    the palace grounds. The Last King was mauled in the mayhem. In the chaos,
    one regal stag bowed to the boy who had freed him; and with Beastmaster
    astride him, leapt the high walls of the estate, and escaped. Now a man,
    Karroch the Beastmaster has not lost his ability to converse with wild
    creatures. He has grown into a warrior at one with nature's savagery.
