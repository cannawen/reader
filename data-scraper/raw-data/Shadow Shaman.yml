heroName: Shadow Shaman
fullHeroName: 'Rhasta, the Shadow Shaman'
description:
  - >-
    Born in the Bleeding Hills, Rhasta was just a starving youngling when picked
    up by a travelling con-man. For two pins of copper, the old con-man would
    tell your fortune. For three, he'd castrate your pig, for five, he'd
    circumcise your sons. For a good meal, he'd don his shaman garb, read from
    his ancient books, and lay a curse upon your enemies. His strange new
    youngling, part hill troll, part... something else, worked as assistant and
    lent an air of the exotic to the con-man's trade.
  - >-
    Always one step ahead of cheated customers, one town ahead of a pursuing
    patronage, the two trekked across the blighted lands until one day the
    con-man realized that the little youngling could actually do what he only
    pretended at. His ward had a giftâ€”a gift that customers valued. And so the
    youngling Rhasta was thrust before the crowds, and the trade-name Shadow
    Shaman was born. The two continued from town to town, conjuring for money as
    Shadow Shaman's reputation grew. Eventually, the pair's duplicitous past
    caught up with them, and they were ambushed by a mob of swindled ex-clients.
    The con-man was slain, and for the first time, Rhasta used his powers for
    darkness, massacring the attackers. He buried his beloved master, and now
    uses his powers to destroy any who would seek to do him harm.
