    Far to the west, in the mountains beyond the Vale of Augury, lie the remains
    of an ancient power, a fount of eldritch energy nestled deep in the high
    woods. It is said that the things that grow here, grow strangely. To the
    forces of nature this is a sacred place, made to stay hidden and unknown.
    Many are the traps and dangers of this land—all-consuming grasses and
    crossbred fauna and poisonous flowers—but none are so fierce as the mighty
    Treant Protectors. These ageless, titanic beings, charged with keeping the
    peace in this dangerous land, ensure that none within encroach without
    reason, and none without poach their secrets. For time untold they tended to
    their holy ground, uninterrupted, only dimly aware of the changing world
    beyond. Yet inevitably the wider world grew aware of this untamed land, and
    with each passing winter the outsiders grew bolder. Soon they arrived with
    tools to cut and with flames to burn, and often the Treants would ponder:
    who are these fragile, industrious creatures? What now had become of the
    wild, green world? There came and went an age of questions and of doubts, a
    thousand summers of long traditions set to scrutiny, while more and more the
    outsiders died and fed their earth. When all that bloomed had finally
    finished their say, curiosity had overcome caution. It was decided: a lone
    Protector would be sent into the wider world, and instructed to wander until
    the glaciers arose once more, to observe the changing land and its
    creatures, and to discover what unknown dangers could threaten their sacred
    ground.

abilityDescriptions:
  - >-
    Treant Protector blends in with the forest, becoming invisible to enemies
    and gaining a movement speed bonus when near a tree. This activates after
    not attacking for a short period of time. When attacking out of
    invisibility, Treant Protector roots the target. If Treant Protector moves
    away from the tree, the invisibility is lost. Treant Protector can cast
    spells and remain invisible under Nature's Guise.
  - >-
    Treant plants a life-sapping seed in an enemy unit, draining its health,
    while simultaneously slowing it. The seed heals friendly units around it
    equal to the amount drained.
  - >-
    Target an allied unit or structure. Grants bonus regeneration and damage
    block from heroes.
  - >-
    Summons an overgrowth of damaging vines and branches around Treant that
    prevent afflicted enemies from moving, blinking, going invisible, or
    attacking.
  - >-
    Treant Protector enchants a target tree. Enchanted trees grant unobstructed
    vision. If Overgrowth is cast by Treant Protector, units near an enchanted
    tree will be ensnared and damaged.
  - Improves the respawn time of trees on the map down to a few seconds.
