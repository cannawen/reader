heroName: Viper
fullHeroName: 'Viper, the Netherdrake'
description:
  - >-
    The malevolent familiar of a sadistic wizard who captured and hoped to tame
    him, Viper was curiously glad to have been sprung from the sealed and
    unchanging subterranean Nether Reaches where his race had lived for millions
    of years, after tectonic slippage had sealed off the Netherdrakes in
    luminous caverns. Viper spent some time appearing to submit to the wizard's
    enchainments, hoping to learn what he could of the dark magics the mage
    practiced. But he soon realized that few spells were as deadly as the toxins
    that were his birthright. Exuding an acid that swiftly ate away the bars of
    his cage, the Netherdrake slipped free of his confines, spit poison in the
    old spellcaster's eyes, and soared out to let the world know that it had a
    new master.

  - Poison Attack
  - Nethertoxin
  - Corrosive Skin
  - Viper Strike
abilityDescriptions:
  - >-
    Intensifies Viper's venom, adding an effect to his normal attack that slows
    attack and movement speed while dealing damage over time based on how much
    health the target is missing.
  - >-
    Viper releases a Nethertoxin at the targeted area. Units in that area take
    damage over time, have lower magic resistance, and have their passives
    broken.
  - >-
    Viper exudes an infectious toxin that damages and slows the attack speed of
    any enemy that attacks it. It also passively increases Viper's magic
    resistance.
  - >-
    Viper slows the targeted enemy unit's movement and attack speed while also
    dealing poison damage over time. The slowing effect reduces over the
    duration of the poison.

     Upgradeable by Aghanim's Scepter. Increases the cast range, decreases the mana cost, and decreases the cooldown.
