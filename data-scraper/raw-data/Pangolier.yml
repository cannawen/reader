fullHeroName: 'Donte Panlin, the Pangolier'
description:
  - >-
    The men and women that make up the Nivan Gallants live a life of swordplay,
    chandelier swinging, and tawdry romance. And while all adhere to their creed
    that "A life of adventure is the only life worth living," the exploits of
    Donte Panlin still manage to raise the eyebrows of even the most hedonistic
    of swordsmen.
  - >-
    There is no monster he won't slay. No creature he won't woo. No tyrant he
    won't stand against. And no noble immune to his silver tongue.

    Vector Targeted. Pangolier dashes along the target line, then slashes all
    enemies in the drawn direction with several quick swipes.


    Heartpiercer has a chance to activate on hit.
  - >-
    Pangolier jumps forward a short distance in the air and slams back to the
    ground, damaging all enemies in a radius. For each enemy hero hit, he gains
    damage resistance for a short time.


    Forward movement is maintained if Shield Crash is used while Rolling Thunder
    is active, allowing Rolling Thunder to clear walls and cliffs.
  - >-
    Pangolier reads his enemies perfectly, deftly slipping his blade past
    defenses. Each attack has a chance to negate enemy armor and slow the target
    for a duration, activating after a short delay.
  - >-
    Pangolier curls into a spell immune ball and rolls out. When rolling, he
    moves at an increased speed and can move through trees, but has a decreased
    ability to turn. Striking enemies knocks them back, inflicting damage and
    stunning them when they land.


    Colliding with walls or cliffs will cause a temporary pause while Pangolier
    reverses in direction.
  - Stop rolling.
