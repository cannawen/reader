    It's an easy thing to offend a troll. A prickly and contentious race, trolls
    thrive on argument and strife, missing no excuse to raise their voices in
    dispute. Males grow to maturity in subterranean chambers beneath their
    matriarch's domicile, feeding and amusing themselves while contributing
    nothing. Often they stay for years beyond the age of maturity, while the
    matriarch provides them with sustenance. When young trolls are finally
    pushed from their sub-chamber, they gather with others of their kind,
    forming roving gangs of malcontents who complain loudly about all manner of
    vexation.

    As much as trolls love to argue, imagine how rare it is for a troll to be
    driven from his own kind for being too difficult to get along with. Such was
    Jah'rakal's fate, a monger troll from deep in the Hoven. So deluded was he,
    so bitter and abrasive, that even other trolls found his company
    intolerable. After one particularly vitriolic outburst in which he claimed
    the lion's share of loot from their latest raid, his cohorts finally
    snapped. They turned on him, beat him with clubs, and drove him from the
    encampment. Enraged at his banishment, he returned the next day, armed with
    steel, and slew them all, one by one. He then swore a blood oath: he would
    ever after be a fighting force unto himself. Now he roams the world as the
    Troll Warlord, bitter and angry, the Imperial high commander of an army of
    one.
