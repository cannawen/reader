    Well may you ask, "How did this world take its form?" Why of all the worlds
    in creation, has this one its strange properties, its diverse and motley
    collection of creatures, cultures and lore? "The answer," One whispers,
    "lies with the Titans."
  - >-
    These original progenitors were there near the Beginningâ€”if not actual
    witnesses to the creation, then born with it still echoing in their ears.
    Stamped with the earliest energies of the universe, they wished nothing more
    than to continue as creators themselves. Thus they bent to the task of
    shaping matter to their will: hammering and heating, bending and blasting.
    And when matter proved less challenging than they liked, they turned their
    tools upon themselves, reshaping their minds and reforging their spirits
    until they had become beings of great endurance. Reality itself became the
    ultimate object of their smithing. Yet, along the way, they sometimes erred.
    In cases of great ambition, mistakes are unavoidable.

    The one we know as the Elder Titan was a great innovator, one who studied at
    the forge of creation. In honing his skills, he shattered something that
    could never be repaired, only thrown aside. He fell into his own broken
    world, a shattered soul himself. There he dwelt among the jagged shards and
    fissured planes, along with other lost fragments that had sifted down
    through the cracks in the early universe. And this is why the world we know
    resembles an isle of castaways, survivors of a wreck now long forgotten.
    Forgotten, that is, by all but the One who blames himself. He spends his
    time forever seeking a way to accomplish the repairs, that he might rejoin
    the parts of his broken soul, that we and the world alike might all be
    mended. This is the One we know as Elder Titan.
