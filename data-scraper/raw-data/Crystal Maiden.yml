heroName: Crystal Maiden
fullHeroName: 'Rylai, the Crystal Maiden'
description:
  - >-
    Born in a temperate realm, raised with her fiery older sister Lina, Rylai
    the Crystal Maiden soon found that her innate elemental affinity to ice
    created trouble for all those around her. Wellsprings and mountain rivers
    froze in moments if she stopped to rest nearby; ripening crops were bitten
    by frost, and fruiting orchards turned to mazes of ice and came crashing
    down, spoiled. When their exasperated parents packed Lina off to the
    equator, Rylai found herself banished to the cold northern realm of
    Icewrack, where she was taken in by an Ice Wizard who had carved himself a
    hermitage at the crown of the Blueheart Glacier. After long study, the
    wizard pronounced her ready for solitary practice and left her to take his
    place, descending into the glacier to hibernate for a thousand years. Her
    mastery of the Frozen Arts has only deepened since that time, and now her
    skills are unmatched.
