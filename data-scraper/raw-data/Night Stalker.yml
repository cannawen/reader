fullHeroName: 'Balanar, the Night Stalker'
description:
  - >-
    Of the Night Stalker, there is no history, only stories. There are ancient
    tales woven into the lore of every race and every culture, of an impossible
    time before sunlight and daytime, when night reigned alone and the world was
    covered with the creatures of darkness—creatures like Balanar the Night
    Stalker.
  - >-
    It is said that on the dawn of the First Day, all the night creatures
    perished. All, that is, save one. Evil's embodiment, Night Stalker delights
    in his malevolence. He created the primal role of the Night Terror, the
    Boogeyman, and as long as there have been younglings, his is the specter
    summoned to terrify them. This is a role he relishes—nor are these empty
    theatrics. He does indeed stalk the unwary, the defenseless, those who have
    strayed beyond the lighted paths or denied the warnings of their
    communities. Night Stalker serves as living proof that every child's worst
    nightmare....is true.
