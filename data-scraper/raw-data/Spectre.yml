heroName: Spectre
fullHeroName: 'Mercurial, the Spectre'
description:
  - >-
    Just as higher states of energy seek a lower level, the Spectre known as
    Mercurial is a being of intense and violent energy who finds herself
    irresistibly drawn to scenes of strife as they unfold in the physical world.
    While her normal spectral state transcends sensory limitations, each time
    she takes on a physical manifestation, she is stricken by a loss of
    self—though not of purpose. In the clash of combat, her identity shatters
    and reconfigures, and she begins to regain awareness. She grasps that she is
    Mercurial the Spectre—and that all of her Haunts are but shadows of the one
    true Spectre. Focus comes in the struggle for survival; her true mind
    reasserts itself; until in the final moments of victory or defeat, she
    transcends matter and is restored once more to her eternal form.

abilityDescriptions:
  - >-
    Spectre flings a dagger to draw a Shadow Path, dealing damage and slowing
    the movement speed of any enemies along the trail. Units hit by the dagger
    also trail a Shadow Path. While treading the path, Spectre phases through
    otherwise impassable terrain and gains movement speed.
  - >-
    Deals bonus pure damage when Spectre attacks an enemy with no nearby allied
    units. Reduces enemy vision.
  - >-
    Damage done to Spectre is reflected on her enemies, leaving her unharmed.
    The effect lessens with distance.
  - >-
    Creates a spectral nemesis to attack each enemy hero after a short delay.
    Haunts are uncontrollable, take extra damage, and deal less damage than
    Spectre herself. At any moment during the duration, Spectre can use Reality
    to switch places with a Haunt illusion.
  - >-
    Spectre switches places with a chosen Haunt, confusing enemies to wonder
    which is the real Spectre.
