heroName: Mirana
fullHeroName: 'Mirana, the Princess of the Moon'
description:
  - >-
    Born to a royal family, a blood princess next in line for the Solar Throne,
    Mirana willingly surrendered any claim to mundane land or titles when she
    dedicated herself completely to the service of Selemene, Goddess of the
    Moon. Known ever since as Princess of the Moon, Mirana prowls the sacred
    Nightsilver Woods searching for any who would dare poach the sacred luminous
    lotus from the silvery pools of the Goddess's preserve. Riding on her
    enormous feline familiar, she is poised, proud and fearless, attuned to the
    phases of the moon and the wheeling of the greater constellations. Her bow,
    tipped with sharp shards of lunar ore, draws on the moon's power to charge
    its arrows of light.
