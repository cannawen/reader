fullHeroName: 'Leshrac, the Tormented Soul'
description:
  - >-
    Leshrac, Tormented Soul, is an entity torn from the heart of nature, a
    liminal being that exists half in one plane of existence, half in another.
    His penetrating intelligence is such that he can never ignore for a moment
    the agonizing horror at the heart of all creation. Once a great philosopher
    who sought the meaning of existence, he plumbed the depths of nature with
    the haunted Chronoptic Crystals, and was forever altered by the hideous
    mysteries thereby revealed to him. Now the darkest depths of his
    enlightenment are illumined only by the fitful glare of his arrogance. Like
    other elemental characters, he is completely at one with nature, but in his
    case it is a nature lurid and vile. He alone sees the evil truth of reality,
    and has no use for those who believe the cosmos reserves a special reward
    for those who practice benevolence.
