heroName: Vengeful Spirit
fullHeroName: 'Shendelzare, the Vengeful Spirit'
description:
  - >-
    Even the most contented Skywrath is an ill-tempered creature, naturally
    inclined to seek revenge for the slightest insult. But Vengeful Spirit is
    the essence of vengeance. Once a proud and savage Skywrath scion,
    Shendelzare was first in succession for the Ghastly Eyrie until a sister's
    treachery robbed her of her birthright. Snared in an assassin's net,
    Shendelzare tore free only at the cost of her wings, limping away in the
    ultimate humiliation: On foot. With her wings broken, she knew the Skywrath
    would never accept her as ruler; and in the highest roost of the Eyrie,
    inaccessible except by winged flight, her sister was untouchable. Unwilling
    to live as a flightless cripple, and desiring revenge far more than earthly
    power, the fallen princess drove a bargain with the goddess Scree'auk: She
    surrendered her broken body for an imperishable form of spirit energy,
    driven by vengeance, capable of doing great damage in the material plane.
    She may spend eternity flightless, but she will have her revenge.
