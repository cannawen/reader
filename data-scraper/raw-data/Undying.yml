fullHeroName: 'Undying, the Almighty Dirge'
description:
  - >-
    How long has it been since he lost his name? The torn ruin of his mind no
    longer knows.
  - >-
    Dimly he recalls armor and banners and grim-faced kin riding at his side. He
    remembers a battle: pain and fear as pale hands ripped him from his saddle.
    He remembers terror as they threw him into the yawning pit of the Dead God
    alongside his brothers, to hear the Dirge and be consumed into nothingness.
    In the darkness below, time left them. Thought left them. Sanity left them.
    Hunger, however, did not. They turned on each other with split fingernails
    and shattered teeth. Then it came: distant at first, a fragile note at the
    edge of perception, joined by another, then another, inescapable and
    unending. The chorus grew into a living wall of sound pulsing in his mind
    until no other thought survived. With the Dirge consuming him, he opened his
    arms to the Dead God and welcomed his obliteration. Yet destruction was not
    what he'd been chosen for. The Dead God demanded war. In the belly of the
    great nothing, he was granted a new purpose: to spread the Dirge across the
    land, to rally the sleepless dead against the living. He was to become the
    Undying, the herald of the Dead God, to rise and fall and rise again
    whenever his body failed him. To trudge on through death unending, that the
    Dirge might never end.

abilityDescriptions:
  - >-
    Undying steals Strength from all enemy heroes in an area, dealing damage as
    he claims the enemy's strength for himself.

     Upgradeable by Aghanim's Scepter. Increases Decay's strength steal.
  - >-
    Redirects the flow of energy through a target friendly or enemy unit,
    healing or damaging it depending on how many units are near Undying. Each
    counted unit takes damage.
  - >-
    Summons a tombstone at the target point. Zombies will frequently spawn next
    to every enemy unit in the area around the Tombstone, and attack them.
    Zombies have the Deathlust ability, which causes their attacks to slow the
    target, and increases the attack and movement speed of the zombie. Deathlust
    triggers when the target reaches below a certain amount or percentage of
    health, whichever comes first.
  - >-
    Undying transforms into a horrifying flesh golem that possesses a Plague
    Aura. This aura slows all enemy units within range and amplifies the damage
    they take; the closer to Undying, the more damage and the greater the slow.
    When a plagued unit dies, Undying is healed equal to a percentage of his
    maximum health.
  - Comes back to life with full health and mana after a few seconds.
  - >-
    Slows enemy units on attack. If the attacked unit's health goes below the
    threshold, the zombie receives enhanced movement and attack speed.
  - This creature does not feel the effects of most spells.
