heroName: Spirit Breaker
fullHeroName: 'Barathrum, the Spirit Breaker'
description:
  - >-
    Barathrum the Spirit Breaker is a lordly and powerful being, a fierce and
    elemental intelligence which chose to plane-shift into the world of matter
    to take part in events with repercussions in the elemental realm that is his
    home. To that end, he assembled a form that would serve him well, both in
    our world and out of it. His physical form borrows from the strengths of
    this world, blending features both bovine and simian—horns, hooves and
    hands—as outward emblems of his inner qualities of strength, speed and
    cunning. He wears a ring in his nose, as a reminder that he serves a hidden
    master, and that this world in which he works is but a shadow of the real
    one.
