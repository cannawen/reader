  - >-
    The sacred science of Chymistry was a Darkbrew family tradition, but no
    Darkbrew had ever shown the kind of creativity, ambition, and recklessness
    of young Razzil. However, when adulthood came calling he pushed aside the
    family trade to try his hand at manufacturing gold through Alchemy. In an
    act of audacity befitting his reputation, Razzil announced he would
    transmute an entire mountain into gold. Following two decades of research
    and spending and preparation, he failed spectacularly, quickly finding
    himself imprisoned for the widespread destruction his experiment wrought.
    Yet Razzil was never one to take a setback lightly, and sought escape to
    continue his research. When his new cellmate turned out to be a fierce ogre,
    he found just the opportunity he needed. After convincing the ogre not to
    eat him, Razzil set about carefully concocting a tincture for it to drink,
    made from the moulds and mosses growing in the prison stone work. In a
    week's time, it seemed ready. When the ogre drank the potion, it flew into
    an unstoppable berserker rage, destroying the cell bars and exploding
    through walls and guards alike. They soon found themselves lost somewhere in
    the forest surrounding the city with a trail of wreckage in their wake and
    no signs of pursuit. In the tonic's afterglow, the ogre seemed serene,
    happy, and even eager. Resolving to work together, the pair set off to
    collect the materials needed to attempt Razzil's Alchemic transmutation once
    more.

    Sprays highly volatile acid across the target area. Enemy units within the
    contaminated area take damage per second and have their armor reduced.
  - >-
    Alchemist brews up an unstable concoction that he can throw at an enemy
    hero, to stun and deal damage. The longer the concoction brews, the more
    damage it deals and the longer the target is stunned. After a few seconds,
    the brew reaches its maximum damage and stun time. If not thrown after that
    point, the concoction will explode on Alchemist himself.
  - Throw the Unstable Concoction before it blows up.

    Alchemist gets bonus gold for killing creeps. The bonus stacks if creeps are
    killed within a period of time, after which the count is reset. Duration
    refreshes if a stack is made during the duration. Also provides bonus Bounty
    Rune gold.

    Alchemist causes his Ogre to enter a chemically induced rage, reducing base
    attack time, increasing movement speed, and increasing base regeneration of
    hit points and mana points.

    Allows Alchemist to cast Aghanim's Scepter to directly grant any allied hero
    all Aghanim's Scepter bonuses as a permanent buff. The scepter is consumed
    in the process. Multiple instances of this buff do not stack. Alchemist can
    also target himself.
  - >-
    Alchemist's attacks strike down multiple targets. Cleave damage is reduced
    by armor type but not by armor value. Radius expands forward in a cone
    shape.
