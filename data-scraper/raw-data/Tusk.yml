description:
  - >-
    It had been a brawl to remember. There stood Ymir, the Tusk, the Terror from
    the Barrier, the Snowball from Cobalt, the only fighter to have bested the
    Bristled Bruiser in a fair fight, and now the last man standing in Wolfsden
    Tavern. What started as a simple bar bet of supremacy ended with four
    regulars, a blacksmith, and six of the Frost Brigade's best soldiers
    writhing against the shards and splinters of almost every bottle, mug, and
    chair in the building. The Tusk boasted and toasted his victory as he
    emptied his brew.
  - >-
    No sooner had the defeated regained consciousness than the cries for
    double-or-nothing rang out. The Tusk was pleased at the prospect, but none
    could think of a bet bigger than the one he just conquered. Horrified at the
    damage to his tavern and desperate to avoid another brawl, the barkeep had
    an idea. As skilled as he was, Ymir had never taken part in a real battle,
    never tested himself against the indiscriminate death and chaos of war. He
    proposed a wager to the fighter: seek out the biggest battle he could find,
    survive, and win it for whichever side he chose. The stakes? The next round
    of drinks.

    Tusk compresses shards of ice into a wave of frozen energy that damages all
    enemies in comes in contact with. When the wave reaches the targeted point
    the shards are released, creating a barrier.

    Tusk begins rolling into a snowball. Allies nearby can be added to the
    snowball by right clicking on them. Once launched, any enemies caught in the
    snowball's path will be stunned and take damage. Each allied hero in the
    snowball will add to its speed and damage.
  - >-
    The snowball begins rolling toward the target. This will occur automatically
    if not cast within 3 seconds.
  - >-
    Tusk summons a flying Frozen Sigil by calling upon the deepest cold of
    winter. The Sigil creates a snowstorm which slows all enemy units within
    range.
  - >-
    Tusk connects with his mighty Walrus Punch, a critical strike that launches
    its victim into the air. The victim will be slowed upon landing.
  - 'Kicks the target away, dealing damage and slowing them for a few seconds.'
