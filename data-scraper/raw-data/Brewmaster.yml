fullHeroName: 'Mangix, the Brewmaster'
description:
  - >-
    Deep in the Wailing Mountains, in a valley beneath the Ruined City, the
    ancient Order of the Oyo has for centuries practiced its rites of holy
    reverie, communing with the spirit realm in grand festivals of drink. Born
    to a mother's flesh by a Celestial father, the youth known as Mangix was the
    first to grow up with the talents of both lineages. He trained with the
    greatest aesthetes of the Order, eventually earning, through diligent
    drunkenness, the right to challenge for the title of Brewmaster—that
    appellation most honored among the contemplative malt-brewing sect.
  - >-
    As much drinking competition as mortal combat, Mangix for nine days drank
    and fought the elder master. For nine nights they stumbled and whirled,
    chugged and struck, until at last the elder warrior collapsed into a drunken
    stupor, and a new Brewmaster was named. Now the new, young Brewmaster calls
    upon the strength of his Oyo forebears to speed his staff. When using magic,
    it is to his spirit ancestors that he turns. Like all Brewmasters before
    him, he was sent out from his people with a single mission. He wanders the
    land, striving toward enlightenment through drink, searching for the answer
    to the ancient spiritual schism—hoping to think the single thought that will
    unite the spirit and physical planes again.
