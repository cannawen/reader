description:
  - >-
    Born in the godless Hazhadal Barrens, Chen came of age among the outlaw
    tribes who eked out an existence in the shimmering heat of the desert. Using
    an ancient form of animal enthrallment, Chen's people husbanded the hardy
    desert locuthi, a stunted species of burrowing dragon that melted desert
    sands into tubes of glass where twice-a-year rains collected. Always on the
    edge of starvation and thirst, fighting amongst their neighbors and each
    other, Chen's clan made the mistake, one fateful day, of ambushing the wrong
    caravan.
  - >-
    In the vicious battle that followed, Chen's clan was outmatched. The armored
    Knights of the Fold made short work of the enthralled locuthi, who attacked
    and died in waves. With their dragons dead, the tribesmen followed. Chen
    struggled, and slashed, and clawed, and perishedâ€”or would have. Defeated, on
    his knees, he faced his execution with humility, offering his neck to the
    blade. Moved by Chen's obvious courage, the executioner halted his sword.
    Instead of the blade, Chen was given a choice: death or conversion. Chen
    took to the faith with a ferocity. He joined the Fold and earned his armor
    one bloody conversion at a time. Now, with the fanaticism of a convert, and
    with his powers of animal enthrallment at their peak, he seeks out
    unbelievers and introduces them to their final reward.
