description:
  - >-
    Lanaya, the Templar Assassin, came to her calling by a path of curious
    inquiry. Possessed of a scientific bent, she spent her early years engaged
    in meticulous study of nature's lawsâ€”peering into grimoires of magic and
    alchemy, recreating experiments from charred fragments of the Violet
    Archives, and memorizing observations of the Keen recordkeepers. Already
    quiet and secretive by nature, the difficulty of acquiring these objects
    further reinforced her skills of stealth. Had she been less retiring, she
    might have become notorious among the guilds as a thief-scholar. Instead her
    investigations led her into far more obscure corners. As she devoted her
    furtive talents to unlocking the secrets of the universe, she instead
    unlocked a secret door that exists in nature itself: the entryway to the
    most Hidden Temple. The intelligences that waited beyond that portal, proved
    to be expecting her, and whatever mysteries they revealed in the moment of
    their discovery was nothing compared to the answers they held out to Lanaya
    should she continue in their service. She swore to protect the mysteries,
    but more to the point, in service to the Hidden Temple she satisfies her
    endless craving for understanding. In the eyes of each foe she expunges, a
    bit more of the mystery is revealed.
