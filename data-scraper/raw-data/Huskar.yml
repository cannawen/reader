fullHeroName: 'Huskar, the Sacred Warrior'
description:
  - >-
    Emerging from the throes of the sacred Nothl Realm, Huskar opened his eyes
    to see the prodigal shadow priest Dazzle working a deep incantation over
    him. Against the ancient rites of the Dezun Order, Huskar's spirit had been
    saved from eternity, but like all who encounter the Nothl he found himself
    irrevocably changed. No longer at the mercy of a mortal body, his very
    lifeblood became a source of incredible power; every drop spilled was
    returned tenfold with a fierce, burning energy. However this newfound gift
    infuriated Huskar, for in his rescue from the Nothl, Dazzle had denied him a
    place among the gods. He had been denied his own holy sacrifice. In time the
    elders of the order sought to expand their influence and Huskar, they
    agreed, would be a formidable tool in their campaign. Yet becoming a mere
    weapon for the order that denied him his birthright only upset him further.
    As the first embers of war appeared on the horizon, he fled his ancestral
    home to find new allies, all the while seeking a cause worthy of unleashing
    the power his total sacrifice could bring.

    resistance as his health decreases.

    to slow and inflict a percentage of that hero's current HP at the cost of
    Huskar's own vitality.
