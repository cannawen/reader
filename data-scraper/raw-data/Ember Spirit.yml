description:
  - >-
    Lost within the Wailing Mountains, the Fortress of Flares lay abandoned, its
    training halls empty, its courtyard covered in leaves and dust. Upon a dais
    in its sealed temple rests a topaz cauldron filled with ancient ash,
    remnants of a pyre for the warrior-poet Xin. For three generations, Xin
    taught his acolytes the Bonds of the Guardian Flame, a series of mantras to
    train the mind and body for the harsh realities beyond the fortress walls.
    However, in teaching a warrior's way he earned a warrior's rivals, and in
    his autumn Xin was bested and slain. His followers spread to the wind. Yet
    as years turned to centuries and followers to descendants, his teachings
    endured by subtle whisper and deed. Touched by the teacher's lasting legacy,
    the Burning Celestial, inquisitive aspect of fire, cast himself to the
    Fortress of Flares and reignited the pyre ash. From these glowing embers
    emerged an image of Xin, wreathed in flame, his thoughtful countenance
    prepared to train and to teach, and to spread the fires of knowledge to all
    who seek guidance.

abilityDescriptions:
  - >-
    Xin unleashes fiery bolas that wrap around nearby enemies, anchoring them in
    place and dealing damage per second.
  - >-
    Xin dashes around with blazing speed, attacking all enemies in the targeted
    area and returns to where he was standing after. Deals bonus damage to
    heroes, but less damage to creeps. Xin is invulnerable for the duration of
    this skill.
  - >-
    Xin surrounds himself with a ring of fire that consumes incoming magic
    damage, leaving him unharmed. Ends prematurely if the damage block amount is
    used up before the entire duration is reached.
  - >-
    Xin charges himself with the energy to create a Fire Remnant. The secondary
    ability lets you target a location closest to whichever Remnant you want to
    choose. Xin will then dash out, going through each remnant, and arriving at
    the selected remnant last. Each Remnant you go through causes it to
    detonate, dealing damage in the area around it.
  - >-
    Target the Fire Remnant to arrive at. You dash through all other Fire
    Remnants and end up at the one you targeted, exploding them for area of
    effect damage.
  - Ember Spirit's attacks pierce evasion and blindness.
