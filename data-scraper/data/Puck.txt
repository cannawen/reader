Puck, the Faerie Dragon

Intelligence Hero

While Puck seems at first glance a mischievous, childish character, this quality masks an alien personality. The juvenile form of a Faerie Dragon, a creature that lives for eons, Puck spends countless millennia in its childish form. So while it is technically true that Puck is juvenile, it will continue to be so when the cities of the present age have sloughed away into dust. Its motives are therefore inscrutable, and what appears to be play may in fact hide a darker purpose. Its endless fondness for mischief is the true indicator of Puck's true nature.

Puck launches magic orb that floats in a straight path, damaging enemy units along the way. At any point, Puck may teleport to the orb's location using Ethereal Jaunt.
Ethereal Jaunt
Teleports Puck to the flying Illusory Orb.
Waning Rift
Puck releases a burst of faerie dust that deals damage and silences enemy units nearby.
Phase Shift
